1
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,123
<i>From now on,</i>

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,626
<i>you belong to me.</i>

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,297
<i>You draw maps for me.</i>

4
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>You have a gift.</i>

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>And I'm going to use it
to rule these seas.</i>

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,560
<i>You'll pay me 100 million Berry.</i>

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,106
<i>I don't care how you get it.
Steal it if you have to.</i>

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>When you're able to pay,</i>

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,239
<i>I promise you...</i>

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,995
<i>you and your town will have your freedom.</i>

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>And I always keep my promises.</i>

12
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,473
Arlong did this?

13
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,351
Why?

14
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,354
To punish the villagers.

15
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,068
And to punish me.

16
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,668
- What's going on?
- Nojiko told us about your sacrifice.

17
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,964
We didn't know. Can you ever forgive us?

18
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,507
There's nothing to forgive.

19
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,428
Coco Village is my home.

20
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:21,141
Then it's our turn to sacrifice.
We're done living in fear.

21
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,186
We're gonna march on Arlong Park.
If those fishmen want a fight...

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,523
That's not a fight. That's a massacre.
You will all be killed.

23
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,234
If there's no hope
for us to buy our freedom,

24
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,905
then I say we die trying to fight for it!

25
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,619
No, everyone, please!

26
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,455
No, I... I won't let you do that.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,793
This is my fight.

28
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,586
No.

29
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,089
This is our fight.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,424
Right, guys?

31
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,510
- Finally, I get to cut something.
- But how are we gonna beat Arlong?

32
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,513
- We saw what he did at Baratie.
- Every creature has a weakness.

33
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,266
- Even bulletproof ones?
- I'll know it when I see it.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,518
And when I do,

35
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,813
I won't hesitate.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,126
Captain Nezumi.

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,505
How fares the 16th Branch?

38
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,007
Very well, thank you.

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,302
What brings a vessel of your notoriety
to our tranquil shores?

40
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,930
Follow me. Your men can stay behind.

41
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,776
Vice-Admiral.

42
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,364
The welcoming party has arrived.

43
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,409
Vice-Admiral Garp.
What a pleasure to see you.

44
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,788
You might not think it's a pleasure
when you hear what I have to say.

45
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,708
I have received word
of pirate activity at Coco Village.

46
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,711
Yes, an unfortunate incident.

47
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,798
I assure you,
we have the situation under control.

48
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,676
We also have word
that Arlong and his fishmen

49
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,929
have been running wild
across these islands.

50
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,806
We have been tracking Arlong, yes.

51
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,894
But there is a new crew in these parts,
led by a ruthless killer.

52
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,938
A pirate in a straw hat.

53
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,566
He's the one responsible
for this brutal attack.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,693
- What?
- No.

55
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,236
- Cadets.
- That's not possible.

56
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,154
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

57
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,865
Luffy would never do anything like that.

58
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,203
How dare you accuse me?
I am a Marine captain.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
I'm a vice-admiral.

60
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,457
So let's move past
the grandstanding, shall we?

61
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,044
My apologies, Vice-Admiral.

62
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,672
I'll make sure these pirates
taste the steel of my blade.

63
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,215
You'll do no such thing.

64
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,845
Where is he now?

65
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,015
Where is Luffy?

66
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,102
Let's pick up the pace!
You know Arlong hates to wait.

67
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,739
What the hell is this? Who would be
stupid enough to attack us?

68
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,706
Fishmen! Stand by to repel boarders!

69
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,131
Where's Arlong?

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,633
He's probably in the map room.

71
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,178
Then that's where we're going.

72
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,377
Not the face.

73
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
Shit.

74
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,847
What is this place?

75
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,766
Let's just grab our map
and get out of here.

76
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,440
He let me stop wearing them when I was 12.

77
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,151
He said it was a birthday gift.

78
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,656
Come on. Let's go.

79
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,409
But you just got here.

80
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,666
Welcome to Arlong Park.

81
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,728
Ah!

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,803
- I had that one.
- If you had him, I wouldn't have got him.

83
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,691
Humans have ruled the seas
for far too long.

84
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,278
Looking down from their ivory towers.

85
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,198
Towers built on the backs of fishmen.

86
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,910
Your government fear my people, so

87
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,622
you forced us into slavery.

88
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,790
No one should be forced into anything.

89
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,714
Everyone should be free
to live as they choose.

90
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,920
Save your sympathies, boy.

91
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,966
Our abuse and persecution end now.

92
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,972
I will lead the fishmen
as we mount a revolution for the ages.

93
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,809
It's your turn
to know humiliation and pain.

94
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,269
Haven't you done enough?

95
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,356
I'm just getting started, darling.

96
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,319
But, Nami, you...
you could have been spared,

97
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,656
taking your place right by my side.

98
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,493
But no, just like the rest of your kind,
you betrayed me.

99
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,162
And for what? For this?

100
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,873
You were never going to spare me.

101
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,459
You told Nezumi about my stash.

102
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,588
I'm just playing by human rules.

103
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,844
With these maps, I will create a world
where the fishmen reign supreme.

104
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,390
With knowledge of every Marine base
and pirate stronghold,

105
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,601
nothing can stop me
from taking the East Blue

106
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,020
and every other sea after that.

107
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,521
Oh yes.

108
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,192
And, Nami, it's all thanks to you.

109
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,070
Hmm.

110
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,200
So tell me, Pirate King...

111
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,790
Could you have used her so effectively?

112
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,001
Use?

113
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,640
- No!
- Nami isn't some tool to be used!

114
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,728
She's a person
with wants and dreams of her own,

115
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,063
and you took those away from her.

116
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,400
You're no better than that Axe-Hand guy
or that fake butler

117
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,153
or anyone else
who tries to hurt other people.

118
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,157
So I'm gonna kick your ass,
just like I did theirs.

119
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,871
'Cause no one messes with my friends.

120
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,458
I'll do you the kindness
of killing you all together.

121
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,792
Get out of here, Nami.

122
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,961
- But, Luffy...
- Just go. I got this.

123
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,796
Think you can escape me, Nami!?

124
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,636
Round two, Arlong.

125
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,152
I just need one clean shot. You got this.

126
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,880
Come out
and face the wrath of my special...

127
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,739
Ah! Ah!

128
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
You look tired.

129
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,126
Maybe you should take a break.

130
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,215
- You ought to get back in the kitchen.
- Quit screwing around!

131
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,842
Luffy needs us!

132
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,014
You just got here.
You don't know what Luffy needs.

133
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,686
- I know he needs my cooking.
- Putting two slices of bread together?

134
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,692
- Someone's feeling threatened.
- Shut up!

135
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,404
Then get me back to my body!
We're close. I can feel my toes.

136
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,531
Trust me.
I can help you guys win this thing.

137
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,408
I swear, clown, if you screw us over...

138
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,494
Ow! God!

139
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,538
Yes!

140
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,880
Yes! Yes! Oh!

141
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,134
Oh, it's so much better
than I even remembered.

142
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,595
Hey, so, um...

143
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm gonna get out of here.

144
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,059
- Hey!
- Sorry, kiddos.

145
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,771
I'd love to make things right,
but it's time to exit stage left.

146
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,023
Fucking clown.

147
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,714
Too bad, little one. Just when
we were starting to have some fun.

148
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,515
Gotcha.

149
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,560
Hey, neck flaps, where are you going?

150
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,271
You haven't even tried my hot sauce.

151
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,316
That still won't save you.

152
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,068
My skin is tougher than bullets.

153
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,364
Maybe you should try
one of my new patented fire rounds.

154
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,616
I'm a fishman.

155
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,701
I don't catch fire.

156
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,036
Maybe you don't.

157
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,291
But alcohol does.

158
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,170
Special Attack. Exploding Star!

159
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,844
Yeah! Ha!

160
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,516
Take that! The Great Captain Usopp
fells another notorious villain.

161
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,980
And no one's around to see it.

162
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,691
It's okay.

163
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,734
They'll believe me.

164
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,405
How dare you strike down my brothers?

165
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,869
You won't be so lucky
against the might of my fishman karate.

166
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,899
Get up.

167
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:25,364
Even with your Devil Fruit powers,
you're no match for me, boy.

168
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,784
Maybe so, but you made our navigator cry.

169
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,661
Gum Gum Pistol!

170
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,370
Ah!

171
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,961
Yes!

172
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,367
You're no match for me.
My kicks can break a ship's keel.

173
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,078
That's nothing.
You should have seen Zeff's kicks

174
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,539
when he found an eggshell
in the crème brûlée.

175
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,833
I get it. Zeff was mean to you. Boo-hoo.

176
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,639
You're nothing but a fool
if you think you can save Nami.

177
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,602
There's a reason
she keeps coming back to me.

178
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,646
Arlong Park is her home.

179
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,189
You mean her prison.

180
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,233
Like it or not,
I brought out the best in her.

181
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,611
She'd be nothing without me.

182
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,236
No.

183
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,410
You'd be nothing without her.

184
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,165
Typical human.

185
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,085
You can't win
if you can't even hit straight.

186
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,795
Maybe I can't beat you.

187
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:09,051
But I can destroy everything you've built.

188
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,935
No!

189
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,523
Ah!

190
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,830
No!

191
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,149
Nami is a fool to have her faith
in such weak compatriots.

192
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,195
You don't ever badmouth Nami.

193
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,655
Now you've done it.

194
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,906
<i>Côtelette!</i>

195
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,199
<i>Collier!</i>

196
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,744
<i>Épaule!</i>

197
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,622
<i>Poitrine!</i>

198
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,336
<i>Mouton</i> Shot!

199
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,970
<i>Mouton</i> shot?

200
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,514
All great fighters call out
their finishing moves.

201
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,310
Yeah, you're gonna fit in just fine.

202
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,355
Never fear, the Great Captain Usopp is...

203
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,232
is...

204
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,652
Oh. You guys did pretty good in here.

205
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,280
Good job, guys.

206
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,871
Nami!

207
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,957
You're all okay!

208
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,336
Where's Luffy?

209
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,631
Still inside,

210
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,341
fighting Arlong.

211
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,843
He's gonna be all right.

212
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,514
Right?

213
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:29,149
Gum Gum Gatling!

214
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:55,592
No puny human can bring down Arlong Park!

215
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,723
Gum Gum...

216
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,061
...Battle Axe!

217
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,574
Luffy!

218
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,637
Nami!

219
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,015
You are our friend!

220
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,517
We are your crew!

221
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,554
Bon appétit.

222
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
- Thank you.
- No worries. Have a good night.

223
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,559
- Hey!
- I'm gonna need these recipes too.

224
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,924
You should write a cookbook.

225
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,898
Well, you know, a true artist
never reveals his secrets,

226
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,819
but I could be talked
into offering some private lessons.

227
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,489
Nice try.

228
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,659
There you go, my lovely. Enjoy.

229
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,327
Ooh.

230
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,663
Back for seconds. Must have liked it.

231
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,332
- Yeah, it was okay.
- That plate says different.

232
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,294
Gotta keep my strength up,
even with your cooking.

233
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,006
It's the least you can do, considering
I saved your ass from those fishmen.

234
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,217
- What? I saved <i>your</i> arse.
- You didn't even get your hands dirty.

235
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,636
At least I don't need three swords
to prove I'm a man.

236
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,224
There I was,

237
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,644
completely alone,

238
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,314
surrounded by fishmen,

239
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:01,528
the Great Captain Usopp
staring death in the face.

240
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,365
But I knew I couldn't give up the fight,

241
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,202
not with the fate
of Coco Village at stake!

242
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,913
So I pulled my trusty slingshot!

243
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,129
And I fired on 'em till my fingers bled.

244
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:25,260
And I didn't stop until I single-handedly
defeated Arlong and his deadly crew.

245
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,307
With a little help, of course.

246
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,641
I mean,

247
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,562
I guess I wasn't completely alone.

248
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,192
Three cheers for Captain Usopp!
We couldn't have done it without him!

249
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,568
Whoo!

250
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,868
Marines!

251
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,536
Form lines!

252
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,296
I'd rethink that if I were you.

253
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,217
So these are the Straw Hat Pirates.

254
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,385
Huh.

255
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,553
Marines,

256
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,306
arrest them.

257
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,935
Sir, the Straw Hats didn't destroy
Coco Village. It was Arlong.

258
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,147
You have your orders, cadet.

259
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,899
No.

260
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,990
- What did you say?
- I said no, sir.

261
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:34,204
You do realize there are severe
punishments for disobeying direct orders?

262
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,998
I disagree with those orders, sir.

263
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Me too.

264
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,547
Huh.

265
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,342
Anyone else like to follow their lead?

266
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,846
Or do you all want
to follow orders instead?

267
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,060
Any of them move,

268
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,229
make sure it's their last.

269
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,231
Come here, boy.

270
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,994
I gave you every opportunity
to follow my path,

271
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,246
to become a respected Marine.

272
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,207
But instead,

273
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,586
you chose to become a pirate.

274
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,964
No, Grandpa.

275
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,843
I've always been a pirate.

276
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,178
No more running, boy.

277
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,387
Last chance.

278
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,971
Give it up.

279
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,141
That's not really my thing.

280
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,274
Then show me what you've got.

281
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,833
This is what you wanted, right?

282
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,335
To be a pirate.

283
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,922
Well, I'll show you
what Marines do to pirates.

284
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,176
- I don't want to fight you, Grandpa.
- You've been fighting me your entire life.

285
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,056
Ah!

286
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,936
When are you gonna learn
that you can't win?

287
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,957
I thought I trained you better than this.

288
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,335
You did.

289
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,637
Gum Gum

290
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,683
Rocket!

291
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,850
Ah!

292
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,781
You don't know how dangerous the world is.

293
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,787
The Grand Line isn't some child's game.

294
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,626
I told you, you aren't ready.

295
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,796
You can hit me all day long...

296
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,259
but I'm never giving up on my dream.

297
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,471
- Is that so?
- I'm going to the Grand Line.

298
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,474
And I will find the One Piece.

299
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,687
And I will be...

300
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,065
King of the Pirates.

301
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,979
Have it your way.

302
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,732
Lower your weapons!

303
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,862
What are you all standing around for?

304
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,239
Arlong's pirates are still on the loose.

305
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,325
Hunt them down and arrest them.

306
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
What about these Straw Hats?

307
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,377
What about them?

308
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,712
Arrest them too!
They are the real criminals.

309
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,964
Ooh.

310
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,729
I knew I'd never be able
to change your mind.

311
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,356
You're stubborn.

312
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,649
Just like me.

313
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,945
But I know who you are, boy.

314
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,866
I just needed to make sure
you knew it too.

315
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,246
You were testing me?

316
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,000
Couldn't you have gone
a little bit easier?

317
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,378
Where's the fun in that?

318
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,762
You're on your own now.

319
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,522
No. I'm not.

320
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,317
I have my friends.

321
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,875
I did it, Mom.

322
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,130
I'm free.

323
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,262
My life is finally my own again.

324
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,351
I can move forward with my head held high.

325
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,606
That's what you always wanted, right?

326
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,744
I'm sorry I didn't understand
the sacrifices you made for me.

327
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,207
But now I do.

328
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,756
I know what it means
to fight for your family.

329
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,761
And I promise
I will never lose sight of that.

330
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,849
I know it's late, but I...

331
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,982
I hope you'd be proud of me.

332
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,570
She was always proud of you.

333
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,241
And so am I.

334
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,829
How's your arm?

335
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,670
A little sore, but...

336
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,047
worth it.

337
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,177
Thank you.

338
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,184
Oof, no. Um, those words still sound
a little weird coming out of your mouth.

339
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,355
- Unnatural, right?
- Just a little.

340
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,859
Do you really have to leave?

341
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,237
I was just starting to like you again.

342
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,033
As nice as that is...

343
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,996
I do need to go.

344
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,832
I know.

345
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,293
I just want you to remember that

346
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,920
no matter how far you go,

347
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,507
you will always have
a place here to return to.

348
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,469
- This will always be your home.
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,558

Koby!

360
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,808
- Come to see us off?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

361
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,519
Gonna try to arrest me?

362
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,354
'Cause

363
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,732
that's not a good idea either.

364
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,905
I'm not here as a Marine, Luffy.
I'm here as your friend.

365
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,283
I wanted to show you something.

366
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,835
{\an8}You did it. Finally got your face
on a wanted poster.

367
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,004
Nezumi's last act of revenge.

368
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,637
Yeah! Yes!

369
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,348
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

370
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,352
- That's... that's a lot of Berry!
- It's the highest bounty in the East Blue.

371
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,897
You're a wanted man now.

372
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,193
That's exactly what I wanted.

373
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,501
I guess this is goodbye then.

374
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,594
Goodbye, Koby.

375
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,560
Be a good Marine.

376
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,896
Be a good pirate.

377
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,795
Ah!

378
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,007
Guys!

379
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,134
Check it out.

380
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,187
Hey, look. I'm famous!

381
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,314
What are you on about?
That's Luffy's wanted poster.

382
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,857
Not just Luffy.

383
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,281
Sorry, guys. Maybe if you work
a little harder, you'll get a bounty too.

384
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,532
That doesn't count.

385
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,951
It's okay to be jealous.
Feel what you need to feel.

386
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,203
I... mmm...

387
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,789
- This is stupid.
- This is gonna make things much harder.

388
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,932
With that price on your head,
every bounty hunter in the East Blue

389
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,044
will be gunning for you.

390
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,755
Not just Luffy.
They're gonna be gunning for all of us.

391
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,218
Then it's a good thing
we're not staying in the East Blue.

392
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,642
We're going to the Grand Line.

393
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,221
Oh, Usopp.

394
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,913
Thirty million?

395
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,920
I'll kill the little shit myself.

396
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,547
If you don't, I will.

397
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,818
A hell of a first bounty.

398
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,906
I guess there is
some of me in him after all.

399
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,989
Sir?

400
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,412
I don't regret my actions.

401
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,789
I'm ready to accept my punishment.

402
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,168
Yes. Me too.

403
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,631
Following orders
doesn't make you a good Marine.

404
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,967
It's following your code.

405
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,136
All men have their own brand of justice,

406
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,890
and you both followed yours, so well done.

407
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,479
So you're not going to punish us?

408
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,022
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

409
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,526
My training methods have been called
the worst kind of punishment.

410
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,321
So...

411
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,404
you think you're up for it?

412
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,369
You're gonna train us yourself?

413
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,206
Well, you want to get stronger, don't you?
Learn how to fight?

414
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Yes, sir.

415
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,796
I wanna be worthy of holding my own
against someone like Luffy.

416
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,880
Huh.

417
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,762
And you, what do you want?

418
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,972
I want to show people

419
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,517
that Roronoa Zoro isn't the only one
that knows how to use swords.

420
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,270
I want to get stronger too.

421
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,895
Like my friend.

422
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,648
Or whatever.

423
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,363
Maybe the old chef was right.

424
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,366
It <i>is</i> your turn.

425
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,370
Your training begins tomorrow.

426
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,454
Dismissed.

427
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,306
This is an unusual place
for a man of your stature.

428
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,269
Come on, lads.

429
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,439
We're in the presence
of a mighty Warlord of the Sea.

430
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,151
Show a little... ...respect.

431
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,573
Afraid I'm not in the mood
for a duel today, Hawk Eyes.

432
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,201
- I'm a wee bit hungover.
- I'm not here to fight.

433
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,079
Not when you're half the man
you used to be.

434
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,332
I could still take you.

435
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:00,046
And with one arm tied behind my back.

436
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,052
I recently ran into someone
who might be of interest to you.

437
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,888
A boy you mentioned long ago.

438
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,644
Luffy!

439
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,690
He really did it.

440
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,402
No way. It's Luffy. He's a pirate!

441
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,486
He's a captain!

442
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,573
I guess we better watch our backs.

443
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,785
Bring out the reserve booze, boys!

444
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,328
I thought you were hungover.

445
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,412
Oh, lighten up,

446
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,998
you somber old son of a gun.
Drink with us.

447
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,626
I suppose a drink wouldn't hurt.

448
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,088
- This is cause to celebrate!
- Yeah!

449
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,049
<i>So what do you think?</i>

450
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,682
It's a little piece of home
to take with you on our journey.

451
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,227
And I can whip up tangerine tarts
anytime you want.

452
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,783
It's perfect.

453
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,167
We actually have something for you too.

454
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,295
Usopp, set the main!

455
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,756
Setting the main.

456
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,080
Whoo-hoo!

457
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:58,998
Whoa!

458
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,502
Whoo!

459
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,046
Yeah! Hoo-hoo!

460
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,008
Wha!

461
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,092
Yah!

462
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,179
The entrance to the Grand Line
isn't too far off,

463
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,640
but I think there's a mistake on the map.

464
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,892
What do you mean?

465
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:22,521
Well, it looks like a river
or a canal or something,

466
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,356
but it doesn't make any sense.

467
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,442
These elevations show a mountain.

468
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,402
I mean, how can a river go up a mountain?

469
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,863
You're our navigator.

470
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,990
You'll figure it out.

471
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,073
Hey, Luffy!

472
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,703
Come here. I've got an idea.

473
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,256
Straw Hats!

474
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,761
All hands on deck for a cast-off ceremony.

475
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,526
I'm gonna find the All Blue.

476
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,947
Ah!

477
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,325
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

478
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,332
I'm gonna be
the world's greatest swordsman.

479
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,463
I'm gonna draw a map of the world.

480
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,092
I...

481
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,687
am gonna become
a brave warrior of the sea!

482
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,109
This is it, crew.

483
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,530
The Grand Line.

484
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,868
Nothing's gonna stand in our way!

485
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,829
Yeah!

486
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,789
Whoo!

487
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,291
Whoo!

488
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,421
Yeah!

489
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,968
