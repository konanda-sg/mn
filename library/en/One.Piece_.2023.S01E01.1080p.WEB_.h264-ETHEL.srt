1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,761
<i>This is a world like no other,</i>

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>one brimming with mystery
and teeming with danger,</i>

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>filled with hundreds of islands
strewn across vast seas.</i>

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,696
<i>And throughout these seas are those
who live according to their own rules,</i>

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,783
<i>who seek a life of freedom and adventure.</i>

6
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,455
<i>This is a world of pirates!</i>

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,586
Piracy is a scourge upon this world.

8
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:50,091
{\an8}For too long, villains and miscreants
have sown havoc across our seas.

9
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,970
{\an8}But the Marines,
on behalf of your World Government,

10
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,931
strive to keep you safe and protected.

11
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,812
And today we've made a great stride
in that effort.

12
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,648
Gold Roger,

13
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,444
the so-called King of the Pirates,

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,112
has been captured.

15
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,116
His reign of terror ends this day.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,243
{\an8}Peace shall be restored.

17
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,123
{\an8}Let this be a message to break the spirit
of anyone foolish enough

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,250
to follow in his footsteps.

19
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,962
Gold Roger,

20
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,757
you have been sentenced to death

21
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,260
for the crimes of piracy,

22
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,929
thievery,

23
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,599
and conspiracy
against the World Government.

24
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,393
- Do you have any last words?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,480
Would you take these off?
Starting to itch.

26
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,608
I warned you.

27
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,946
You brought this upon yourself.

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,906
That I did, Vice-Admiral.

29
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,700
Now I'm bringing it to one and all.

30
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,538
By the authority
of the World Government...

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,875
I declare your life

32
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:07,919
forfeit...

33
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,797
Pirate King,
where is your treasure?

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,550
Tell us where you hid it!

35
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,059
You want to know where my treasure is?

36
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,686
I'll tell you.

37
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,396
Wealth.

38
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,397
Fame.

39
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,607
Power.

40
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,278
I found everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,532
Free yourselves.

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,367
Take to the seas!

43
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,412
My treasure is yours to find.

44
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>Gold Roger's final words
changed the world forever.</i>

45
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,039
<i>A new age was born,</i>

46
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,042
<i>the Great Pirate Era,</i>

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,631
<i>setting off a race across the seas
to find the Pirate King's hidden treasure,</i>

48
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,383
<i>the One Piece.</i>

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,899
{\an8}Ever since I was a kid,

50
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,277
{\an8}Shanks would tell me stories
about pirates and their adventures.

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,322
So, yeah, the sea's been calling.

52
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,036
Well, not exactly calling,
because I pretty much can't swim,

53
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,622
but you get the idea.

54
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm setting out to follow my dream,

55
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,378
to find the One Piece

56
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,467
and become King of the Pirates!

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,264
All I need is a loyal crew.

58
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,100
I think about ten men should do.

59
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,853
Well, ten men and a bird.

60
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,441
It's not gonna be easy.
The ocean is... is pretty big

61
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,485
and kind of dangerous.

62
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,281
So what do you say?

63
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,658
Are you with me?

64
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,207
Mutiny.

65
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,263
Oy.

66
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,767
Oh man.

67
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,728
It's my first day.

68
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,376
Load your cannons!

69
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,963
Fire!

70
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,555
Fire!

71
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,981
Take everything!

72
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,281
But leave the crew to me.

73
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,034
Let's show 'em
what true terror looks like.

74
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,239
Where is the pirate hunter Roronoa Zoro?

75
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,241
Don't deny he was on your ship.

76
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,955
He booked passage to Sixis Island.
After that, I don't know.

77
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,835
Liar! I know Zoro must be after me.
Who else is worthy of his pursuit?

78
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,963
He had a list
of pirates and their bounties.

79
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,506
And of course, I was at the top.

80
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,175
Actually, your name wasn't on it.

81
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,554
No! No!

82
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,810
- Koby, clean up this mess.
- Coming, Captain Alvida!

83
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,442
Who's the most powerful pirate
on the seas?

84
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,610
- Alvida!
- Captain Alvida!

85
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,694
Yeah!

86
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,514
Who's there?

87
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,068
Hey!

88
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,031
Knock it off!

89
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,532
Sh.

90
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,078
Please don't kill me.

91
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,747
- Hey.
- Please.

92
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,751
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm not gonna kill you, all right?

93
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,213
I just need you to be quiet.

94
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,756
First things first.

95
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,927
- Do you have any food here?
- What?

96
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,095
I'm starving.

97
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,265
Alvida doesn't let me eat
until after she finishes her meal.

98
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,559
- Who's Alvida?
- This is her ship.

99
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,688
- She's captain of the Alvida Pirates.
- Oh, that's great!

100
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,106
- It is?
- Yeah!

101
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,691
'Cause I'm a pirate too.

102
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,882
You don't look like a pirate.

103
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,656
- What do they look like?
- Pirates are scum.

104
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,408
They're thieves and murderers.

105
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,786
Not the pirates I know.

106
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,844
Shanks. He's back!

107
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,444
Work fast as the breeze, men!

108
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,072
Captain wants this haul
to the traders by nightfall.

109
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,449
Before those Marine bastards
get back on our trail.

110
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,328
Easy with this, Roux. It's worth more
than the rest of the loot put together.

111
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,246
Aye, captain.

112
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,623
Pretend it's a leg of lamb.
You wouldn't drop that.

113
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,672
- Here.
- Got it, Captain.

114
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,717
Luffy! I was wondering when you'd pop up.

115
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,762
Our favorite street urchin
comes to welcome us back.

116
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,680
How ya been, kid?

117
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,308
I'm not an urchin. I'm a pirate!

118
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm not joking.
I'm ready to join your crew.

119
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,231
The sea isn't a child's game.

120
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,943
It's dangerous.
The scars on my face are proof of that.

121
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,988
I can do it, Shanks. I swear.

122
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,947
You're not ready.

123
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,367
I am. And I'll show you!

124
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,165
Might want to take it easy on him,
Captain.

125
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,500
He's got no family to speak of.
The kid's on his own.

126
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,378
Better a disappointed kid now
than a dead one later.

127
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,505
Let's get this done.

128
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,507
- These men need a drink.
- Aye, Captain.

129
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,844
- And a bath.
- Hey, Shanks!

130
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,974
Put it down, Luffy.
Before you hurt yourself.

131
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,436
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.
And I'll prove it to you.

132
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,024
Luffy!

133
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,113
I don't get it.
Why would anyone want to be a pirate?

134
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,866
'Cause it's the best thing there is.

135
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,786
You have the... the wind in your back,

136
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,287
the salty sea air,

137
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,998
your loyal crew by your side.

138
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,959
You never know what's on the horizon.

139
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,631
It's all about being... free.

140
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,509
Nothing's free about Alvida's crew.

141
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,762
She tells me when to eat, when to sleep.

142
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,432
I even have to paint her toenails.

143
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,769
- So why don't you just leave?
- No one leaves Alvida!

144
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,229
She'll never let me go.

145
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,399
You should never let anyone
tell you what you can't do.

146
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,901
If I did that,

147
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,238
I never would've left my village
to go find the One Piece.

148
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,574
Gold Roger's treasure?

149
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,036
That's impossible.
Every pirate in the world is after that.

150
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,372
Why shouldn't I be the one to find it?

151
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,583
As soon as I'm out of here,
I'm on my way to the Grand Line.

152
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,169
Pirate graveyard.

153
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,382
There are a-hundred-foot waves
and sea beasts that'll crush your bones.

154
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,177
Once you enter the Grand Line,
you never return.

155
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,721
It sounds kind of fun.

156
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,224
Wait!

157
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,520
Is... is that...
is that one of the sea beasts?

158
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,980
It's just Alvida snoring.

159
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,441
If you want to get out of here,
it's now or never.

160
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,781
Lifeboats are tied
at the stern of the ship.

161
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,177
- Gonna need one of these.
- Head due north.

162
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,637
- You should hit land in a few days.
- North.

163
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,097
Which way is north?

164
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,143
What the hell is going on up there?

165
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,310
- What's the meaning of this?
- Alvida, I can explain.

166
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,028
You dare betray me to a bounty hunter?

167
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,154
No, that's not it at all.

168
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,032
And you, you're too scrawny
to be Roronoa Zoro.

169
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,825
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

170
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,035
Never heard of you.

171
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,872
Well, remember the name,
'cause I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

172
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,835
You must be new around here, boy,

173
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,298
because who is
the most powerful pirate on the seas?

174
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,051
- Captain Alvida!
- Captain Alvida!

175
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,636
Ah.

176
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,473
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you, Koby.

177
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,267
Who's the most powerful pirate
on the seas?

178
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,648
- Answer me, you sniveling runt.
- He doesn't have to.

179
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,691
Koby's his own man.

180
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,486
- Shut up.
- No. No, he's not.

181
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,656
He's mine, and he'll always be mine.

182
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,783
That's not what he told me.

183
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,453
He said that you were mean.

184
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,121
And cruel.

185
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,457
And that you're as dumb as a sea cow.

186
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,917
No, Captain Alvida! I didn't!

187
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,307
Whoo!

188
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,186
Ay!

189
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,569
Whoo!

190
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,696
What kind of a monster are you?

191
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,865
The stretchy kind.

192
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,418
Yah!

193
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,937
You! This is all your fault!

194
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,356
Ah!

195
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,280
That's enough.

196
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,742
Gum Gum...

197
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,246
Pistol!

198
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,173
Anyone else got a problem with Koby?

199
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,299
No, sir.

200
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,552
Come on.

201
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,223
We're gonna need a boat
and enough food for a few days.

202
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,684
- Me?
- Yeah!

203
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,312
You're coming with me, right?

204
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,019
You can come out.

205
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:25,317
People often visit shrines
to light candles for those they've lost.

206
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,737
Who are yours for?

207
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,242
{\an8}This one is for someone
I knew a long time ago.

208
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,910
And the other?

209
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,289
You've been following me
for three days.

210
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,714
- What do you want?
- You may call me Mr. 7.

211
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,800
I represent an organization
known as Baroque Works.

212
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,595
We are interested
in your unique set of skills,

213
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,056
pirate hunter Roronoa Zoro.

214
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,435
What are you? Some band of assassins?

215
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,439
We are much, much more.

216
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,151
You should know it's a high honor
to be asked to join our ranks.

217
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,486
Kind of got my own thing going on.

218
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,535
Membership would make you
even more invincible, more feared.

219
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,829
Does it come with a free face tattoo?

220
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,456
My favorite is Number 1.

221
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,920
To turn down Baroque Works

222
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,797
is to forfeit your life.

223
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,133
If they were that serious,

224
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,802
they should've sent
someone better than Number 7.

225
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,466
Ah!

226
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,451
That look on Alvida's face.

227
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,703
I've never seen anyone
stand up to her before.

228
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,790
- Shouldn't have messed with you.
- How did you stretch like that?

229
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,794
It's kind of a long story.

230
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,560
At least you didn't get your eye.

231
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,009
I was aiming for it, but I missed.

232
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,428
Ow.

233
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,057
- I thought you said you were tough.
- I am!

234
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,811
Don't stitch it too good.
I want everyone to see my scar.

235
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,729
Scars don't make the man, Luffy.

236
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,775
It's the lesson behind the scar,
and you didn't earn this one.

237
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,571
Then let me earn it.
I'll be the best pirate ever.

238
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,450
Look, I've been practicing what my face
is gonna look like on my wanted poster.

239
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,957
I've no doubt your mug
will be on a wanted poster one day.

240
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,002
But you're not ready.

241
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,004
My ship already has an anchor.

242
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,672
I'm not an anchor.

243
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,514
Stupid Shanks.

244
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,684
Stupid treasure.

245
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,944
There you go, Captain.

246
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,076
Bring us your best whiskey.

247
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,456
I'm afraid we're out.

248
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,585
That'd be our fault, friend.
We've, uh, been doing some celebrating.

249
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,504
We've drunk the place dry, but...

250
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,841
perhaps this will make up for it.

251
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,099
What can we do with one bottle?

252
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,892
Generally, you drink it.

253
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,030
Now there's glass everywhere.

254
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,156
Mmm.

255
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,158
Makino, got a mop?

256
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,243
Mm-hmm.

257
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,386
Since you like cleaning so much.

258
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,473
Come on, men.

259
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,018
Let's find a real bar.

260
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,167
- He got you good, huh, Cap'n?
- "You got a mop?"

261
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,197
Why are you laughing?

262
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,950
How could you let him
insult you like that?

263
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,869
All he did was spill a drink on me.

264
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,789
But you should've fought back!
Why didn't you kick his ass?

265
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,169
Not everything
can be solved with violence.

266
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,672
A man needs to be strong,
but he also needs to be good.

267
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,090
You're not a real man.

268
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,427
You're nothing but a coward.

269
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,927
You see?

270
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,389
I told you, you weren't ready.

271
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,557
Wait.

272
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,108
Luffy!

273
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,283
What have you done?

274
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,081
<i>You ate a Devil Fruit?</i>

275
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,665
I didn't know any better.

276
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,961
But mine was a Gum Gum Fruit.
It turned my body into rubber.

277
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,464
Eee.

278
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Huh?

279
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
So now what?

280
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,556
- We have to be going somewhere, right?
- We <i>are</i> going somewhere.

281
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,933
Next stop,

282
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,768
to the Grand Line!

283
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,186
Do you know how to get there?

284
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,605
Hmm.

285
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,566
You can't navigate.
You don't even have a map!

286
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,527
Good point.

287
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,738
We should probably pick one up.

288
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,618
Maybe I've made a mistake.
I never should've left Alvida.

289
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,499
Koby, if you could do
anything in the world right now,

290
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,501
what would it be?

291
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,446
I guess there is one thing, but...

292
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,589
it's dumb.

293
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,390
- What was that for?
- You being dumb.

294
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,851
Now spit it out.

295
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,398
I've kind of...

296
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,570
I've always wanted to be...

297
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,866
a Marine.

298
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,370
Ah.

299
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,830
Ever since I was a kid,

300
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,334
I wanted to protect people
that can't protect themselves.

301
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,175
I told you it was dumb.

302
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,801
If that's what you want,

303
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,929
I think you should do it.

304
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,892
I'll help you out.

305
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,852
You don't even know me.

306
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,395
We shared a meal, Koby.

307
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,483
And if being a Marine is your dream...

308
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,069
that's good enough for me.

309
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,613
Okay.

310
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,452
So you plot a course
to the next Marine base.

311
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,995
I get my map,

312
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,916
and you can join up. Yeah.

313
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,545
All right.
Well, I'm gonna take that nap now.

314
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,966
You can't just waltz into a Marine base
and ask for a map to the Grand Line!

315
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,092
Don't worry.

316
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,803
I'm stealthy.

317
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,894
Yeah. Super stealthy.

318
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,545
There's someone in there.
Let's get closer.

319
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,213
Help me!

320
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,341
Water...

321
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,553
Oh, you're in luck, sweetheart.
We're all the help you'll need.

322
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,305
My crew was attacked by pirates.

323
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,267
I... I barely managed to make it out alive.

324
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,434
Pirates, you say?

325
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,061
I hear they're a terrible lot.

326
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,147
The worst sort. Good thing
we found you instead of them.

327
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,570
What you got there? Something to share?

328
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:17,158
No. Please, no,
it's... it's all I have. Please.

329
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,494
It's a fair trade for saving your life.

330
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,962
Hey, what gives?

331
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,050
Sorry, boys. Thanks for the rescue.

332
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,298
Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut.

333
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,430
{\an8}I didn't know
there were so many pirates!

334
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,849
{\an8}There are way worse pirates
on the Grand Line.

335
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,725
It's terrible.

336
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,101
Yeah.

337
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,021
Yeah. I know, right?

338
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,523
Where's my face?

339
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,989
Well, only one way
I'm gonna get inside that base.

340
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,826
And it's not on an empty stomach.

341
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,911
Come on.

342
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,049
We already have our food.

343
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,843
No, more is better. More is better.

344
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,178
You gotta feed the brain.

345
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,390
All right, so...

346
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,143
I can't get inside the base
through the gate,

347
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,816
but maybe... maybe...
maybe what if I get inside flying?

348
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,943
I can grab onto a bird or something.

349
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,403
That's a terrible idea.

350
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,364
Keep your voice down.

351
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,711
A bottle for me, and one for my friend.

352
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,129
He's had a rough day.

353
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,812
Hi.

354
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,815
Can I buy you a drink?

355
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,816
Too tall.

356
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,743
You like rum?

357
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,662
Yeah, sure.

358
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,789
As much as the next guy.

359
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,499
I'm not asking the next guy.

360
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,506
- What's this?
- Rice balls. For you.

361
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,467
- You made them yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,928
- What's the brown stuff?
- Chocolate. Makes everything taste better.

363
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,012
Rika?

364
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,309
You stupid, stupid girl.

365
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,608
- Why don't you watch where you're going?
- Rika, apologize to our guest.

366
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,361
I'm... I'm so sorry.

367
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,239
"I'm so sorry!"

368
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,910
Next time, I won't be so nice.

369
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,579
You dropped my food.

370
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,839
Mmm.

371
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,050
Delicious.

372
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,602
Now you eat one.

373
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,396
And apologize to the girl.

374
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,319
Do you know who I am?

375
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,407
A shithead Marine with a bad haircut.

376
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,871
I wouldn't do that.

377
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,208
Oh, come on, tough guy.
Three swords?

378
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,877
I only need one.

379
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,546
Okay.

380
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,175
But it's gonna hurt.

381
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,097
Oh.

382
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,564
Ah.

383
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,857
Wow.

384
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,482
Good fighter.

385
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,285
You shouldn't draw your blade
unless you're prepared to use it.

386
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,747
Don't kill me, please.
My father will give you anything you want.

387
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,915
Who's your father?

388
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,998
Captain Morgan.

389
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,418
He's in charge of the Marine base.

390
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,755
Then he owes me money.

391
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,430
I understand you sent
four of my Marines to the infirmary.

392
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,560
Without drawing a blade, I might add.

393
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,687
Impressive.

394
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,898
I didn't want to make a mess.

395
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,983
Roronoa Zoro.

396
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,151
The Demon.

397
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,907
Most feared pirate hunter
in the East Blue.

398
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,327
Hmm. I'd say
you live up to your reputation.

399
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,913
If it's all the same,
I'll just take my money and go.

400
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,748
You'll collect your bounty,

401
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:43,962
but the penalty for assaulting a Marine
is seven days strung up in the yard.

402
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,255
No food or water.

403
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,385
You can try to arrest me,
but your brat'll be the first one I kill.

404
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,012
Hey! He can't speak to me that way!

405
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,893
I like you.

406
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,649
Oh, we should be working
for the same team.

407
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,826
You'd make a hell of a Marine.

408
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,244
Hmm.

409
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,289
Kind of got my own thing going on.

410
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,001
Doesn't leave much time
for playing dress-up.

411
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,132
It's a shame
to lose a man of your talents,

412
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,761
since you won't be able
to collect a bounty at any Marine base

413
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,179
once I get the word out.

414
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,808
So what's it gonna be?

415
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,603
A new career?

416
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,565
Or the yard?

417
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,403
Seven days?

418
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,200
I could catch up on my sleep.

419
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,963
I can't stop thinking about that fight.

420
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,127
That guy was amazing.

421
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,130
And what's with the third sword?

422
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,759
I mean, where does it even go?

423
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,968
No.

424
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,016
He had to protect that little girl
from the Marines,

425
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,685
who were supposed to be protecting her.

426
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,687
It doesn't make any sense.

427
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,107
If there are good pirates
and bad pirates, then

428
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,195
there are gonna be good Marines
and bad Marines too.

429
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,159
You'll be one of the good ones.

430
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,370
Maybe Alvida was right.

431
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,750
I don't know anything about the world.

432
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,376
But you were her prisoner.

433
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,088
Yeah, but I knew who I was.

434
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,589
Now I have no idea.

435
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,176
Hey, Koby.

436
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,388
Koby!

437
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,769
I need to get into the base
and find that map,

438
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,395
and I could use some help.

439
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,566
You want me to help you
steal from the Marines?

440
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,193
No. Of course not.

441
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,905
How about you help me

442
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,407
get the boat ready?

443
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,451
You can handle that, right?

444
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,035
I guess so.

445
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,788
What are you gonna do?

446
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,377
I'm working on that.

447
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,093
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

448
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,222
A bit hot for my taste though.

449
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,601
The great Demon.

450
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,940
More like a misbehaving puppy
tied up in the backyard.

451
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,945
What do you say, puppy?
Do you want to do a trick for me?

452
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,489
Sit up and beg.

453
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,991
Hmm?

454
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,450
Hoo!

455
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,534
Put it down!

456
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,370
Ooh.

457
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,168
What's so special
about this old thing? Hmm?

458
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,838
Enjoy these seven days,

459
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,007
'cause when I get down from here,

460
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,634
you'll be the one begging.

461
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,886
When you get down?

462
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,308
You think my father's gonna let you go?

463
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:29,228
You are going to die in this yard.

464
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:41,073
Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut.

465
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:46,078
Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut!

466
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,957
Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut.

467
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,678
Hey.

468
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,274
About face!

469
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,740
Oh, hey. You're the guy from the bar.

470
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,620
- Get lost.
- I am lost.

471
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,331
I'm trying to get inside the base.

472
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,585
Hey, I saw the way you fight.
How did they even arrest you?

473
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,669
They didn't.

474
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,465
I gave myself up.

475
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,509
Interesting choice.

476
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,470
I'm sure you had your reasons.

477
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,583
You don't know anything about me.

478
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,184
I know that you protected that little girl
from those Marines last night.

479
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,229
You're a good guy.

480
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm Roronoa Zoro, the pirate hunter.

481
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,778
Well, I'm Monkey D. Luffy,

482
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,322
and I will be the King of the Pirates.

483
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,701
And I think you should join my crew.

484
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,499
What makes you think
I'd wanna play pirates with you?

485
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,959
You're a great fighter.

486
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,296
I'd say that together,
we'd make a pretty good team.

487
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,715
I kill your kind for a living.

488
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,218
Pirate... hunter.

489
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,678
You keep saying that,

490
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,722
but is that all you are?

491
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,517
Is that all you want?

492
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,696
I made a promise to someone
a long time ago...

493
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,201
to become the world's greatest swordsman.

494
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,871
Impressive.

495
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,298
You can untie me,
but I'm still not gonna join your crew.

496
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,381
Okay.

497
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,803
I mean it.
I don't owe you anything.

498
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,516
I just think it's a waste of time
for you to be hanging out here

499
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,811
when there's something you want out there.

500
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,150
Good luck on the sword thing.

501
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,612
Hey, can you close this behind me?

502
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,952
Thanks!

503
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,849
Hey!

504
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,645
You're not supposed to be in here.

505
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,499
Captain Morgan sent me
to find a map of The Grand Line

506
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,608
ahead of his security briefing
this afternoon.

507
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,404
Why would he do that?
All maps pertaining to The Grand Line

508
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,656
are kept under lock and key
in his private office.

509
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,743
I'm just following orders. But if you want
to question Axe-Hand Morgan, be my guest.

510
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,208
Hey, we don't have any maps
to The Grand Line down here, do we?

511
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,751
Nah, we didn't get any.

512
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,299
Hey, you're that girl from the bar.

513
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,969
The one who stole my uniform.

514
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,776
This is fine.

515
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,570
No problem.

516
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,996
Whoa!

517
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,760
Hmm.

518
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,309
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! No, don't do that.

519
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,770
I'm taking you into custody
for trespassing on a Marine base.

520
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,980
Ah.

521
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,567
Better take yourself into custody too,
'cause you're not a Marine.

522
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,943
Am too.

523
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,778
No, you're not.

524
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,113
I heard everything.

525
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,201
You stole that guy's uniform.
And now you're looking for my map.

526
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,036
Your map?

527
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,913
Yep. My map to The Grand Line.

528
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,040
It's my map,
and I'm not leaving here without it.

529
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,208
Suit yourself.

530
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,046
Hey! Hey! Get back here!

531
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,674
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

532
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,429
Looking for that Morgan guy's office.
Map's there, right?

533
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,389
Copy that.

534
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,830
That's your plan?

535
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,084
Just walk into Axe-Hand Morgan's office
and ask him for the map?

536
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,713
I may have to fight him for it.
Why do they call him Axe-Hand anyways?

537
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,551
You are going to get us both caught
if you keep stomping around this place.

538
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,010
We need a plan.

539
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,182
Ah!

540
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,725
Axe-Hand!

541
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,023
Are you going to kill me?

542
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,607
Oh no.

543
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,527
I've got something much worse in mind.

544
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,198
Captain Morgan, sir, I was just
escorting this prisoner to the brig.

545
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,701
He was arrested
for causing a disturbance in the square.

546
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,201
Yeah.

547
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,537
Prisoner.

548
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,831
I've never seen you before.

549
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,709
I'm a transfer from the 77th, sir.

550
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,838
What's your name, Private?

551
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,464
Nami, sir.

552
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,594
I put in a request
to serve under your command.

553
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,181
Wise choice.

554
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,268
I expect great things from you.

555
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,230
Yeah. She's the best!

556
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,779
I... I mean, she's the best of the worst.

557
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,657
I hate the Marines.

558
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,328
Carry on.

559
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,964
That was amazing. Admit it.
We do make a pretty good team.

560
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,257
We are not a team.

561
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,343
Whatever you say.

562
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,931
Now all we have to do is figure out
a way to get into Axe-Man's office.

563
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,895
Are those his keys?

564
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,647
Oh!

565
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,815
How'd you do that?

566
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,526
I'm a thief.

567
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,902
Ah.

568
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,449
You know, you're really good at thieving...
and a good talker too.

569
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,494
You should think
about joining my pirate crew.

570
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:13,043
Let's get one thing straight.
I am never joining anything with you.

571
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,130
I hate pirates. Hate them!

572
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,009
That's because you don't know <i>me</i> yet.

573
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,951
This guy really likes himself.

574
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,121
I'm going to find the map.
Pretend you're not here.

575
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,331
But I <i>am</i> here.

576
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,335
Why do you
want the map so badly anyway?

577
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,632
I'm gonna use it to find the One Piece
and become King of the Pirates.

578
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,051
- Figures.
- What?

579
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,221
Every idiot dreams
of finding the One Piece.

580
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,558
People like you believe in something
and you don't even know what it is.

581
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,768
Well, yeah.

582
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,935
Don't you?

583
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,732
So why did you decide to become a thief?

584
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,238
I didn't decide. I needed to eat.
You do what you have to, to survive.

585
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,618
You're right.
Nothing more important than food.

586
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,453
Just find the map.

587
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,309
What's going on here?

588
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,729
Pirates, sir, inside the base.
We're under attack!

589
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,439
What pirates?

590
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,819
A woman with orange hair,
dressed like a Marine.

591
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,238
She was trying
to steal a map to The Grand Line.

592
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,783
My keys! Sound the alarm.

593
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,788
Uh...

594
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,833
Do you think they know we're here?

595
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,295
{\an8}No, I think they're after the other thief
and idiot pirate trying to steal a map.

596
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,422
What are the odds of that?

597
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,761
Kidding.

598
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,849
But you might want to work
a little faster.

599
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,436
Open up!

600
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,941
By the authority of the 153rd Marines!

601
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,110
You need to hurry.

602
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,862
- I can't rush this!
- Please hurry!

603
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,531
I have an idea.

604
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,248
- That's your idea?
- Yeah.

605
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,611
How did you do that?

606
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,101
Whoo! Whoo!

607
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,354
Aren't you that drunk from the bar?

608
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,856
Glad I made an impression.

609
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,111
The imposter, the pirate hunter,
and the prisoner.

610
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,198
Fancy that.
The three of you working together.

611
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,701
Yeah. We're a crew!

612
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,494
- Nope, not a crew.
- Not together.

613
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,248
No enemy has ever escaped my wrath.

614
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,043
I alone defeated the Black Cat Pirates.

615
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,506
I alone captured
Kuro of the Thousand Plans.

616
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:14,845
And I alone keep Shells Town safe
from the scum of the East Blue.

617
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,829
Yah!

618
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,089
Ah!

619
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,383
Oh.

620
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,551
Whoa!

621
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,153
Yah!

622
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,687
It's not only the axe.
Every part of his body's a weapon.

623
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,191
I'll go high. You go low.

624
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,259
Ah.

625
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,095
So that's where it goes.

626
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,445
Ah!

627
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,665
Gum Gum Whip!

628
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,507
Whoo!

629
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,427
Ah!

630
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,388
- Gum Gum Whip?
- Yeah!

631
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,933
All the great fighters
call out their finishing moves.

632
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,310
No, they don't.

633
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:11,646
Hate to break up this beautiful moment,
but we need to get this safe out of here.

634
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,275
Maybe if we find some rope or something.

635
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,321
Or we can do that.

636
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,839
- Careful with that!
- Whatever you say.

637
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,465
Oh, wait.

638
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,051
I don't work for you.

639
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,678
I'm sensing a little bit of tension
amongst the crew.

640
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,888
- Not a crew!
- Not a crew!

641
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,893
- I can't leave without my friend.
- Can't wait. The Marines will be here.

642
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,189
The Marines are here already.
You're under arrest.

643
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,780
What's wrong with his hair?

644
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,323
Yeah, I might've done that.

645
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,285
I won't let you make a joke of me.

646
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,372
I'm taking you in
and handing you over to my father.

647
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,626
I'll be the hero.
I might even get a medal or something.

648
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,880
- Koby?
- God, that hurt!

649
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,591
It also felt really good too.

650
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,929
No time to explain, but we gotta go.
This whole island is trying to kill us.

651
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,181
I'm not coming with you.

652
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,728
You sure?

653
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,315
Before we met,
every choice was made for me.

654
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,611
But now I'm gonna do what I want to do.

655
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:43,989
I'm gonna be a Marine.

656
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,700
I want to help people
that can't help themselves.

657
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,372
Next time we meet, we might be enemies.

658
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,248
But for now...

659
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,294
we're friends.

660
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,019
This is Garp.

661
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,982
Pirates, you say?

662
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,821
Raiding our base in Shells Town.

663
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,909
What did they take?

664
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,078
Weapons? Gold?

665
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,723
Change of plan.

666
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,726
We're going to Shells Town.

667
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,729
Got a lead on Baroque Works?

668
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,901
We've been chasing those shadows
a long time. This is different.

669
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,990
A map to the Grand Line has been stolen...

670
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,578
by a pirate in a straw hat.

671
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,844
They were pirates, Captain,
just like us.

672
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,054
And they got the map.

673
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,766
And you didn't stop them.

674
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,102
I couldn't. I mean,
there were three of them.

675
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,188
They must've been planning this
for months.

676
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,545
Well, that's my map.

677
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,923
And I'm gonna get it back.

678
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,179
No matter who I have to kill.

679
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,077
This is my first pirate score.

680
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,707
From now on,
it's all gonna be smooth sailing.

681
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,128
<i>This crew can handle anything.</i>

682
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,757
We've been making enemies
everywhere we go.

683
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,221
Nothing can stop me
from taking the East Blue.

684
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,058
We've been captured. We need a plan.

685
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,393
Ah! Ah!

686
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,145
That went pretty well.

687
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,108
<i>Arlong will kill
the entire village!</i>

688
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,821
- Nami made her choice.
- Ah!

689
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,787
<i>We've got
each other's backs... always.</i>

690
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,877
<i>So these are the Straw Hat Pirates.</i>
