1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,841
{\an8}You want trouble?

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,758
{\an8}You just found it.

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,434
Gum Gum... Pistol!

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,105
Luffy, can't you practice somewhere else?

5
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,066
{\an8}I can fix it. Got any glue?

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,819
It's not the chair I'm worried about.

7
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,742
You need to be careful
with your new abilities.

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,613
I know it's exciting,

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,492
but there might be some people who'll be
afraid of you now that you're... different.

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,119
I like being different.

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,080
These Devil Fruit powers are gonna make me
the greatest pirate ever.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,164
Luffy,

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,210
what do you know about Devil Fruits?

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,129
They don't taste very good.

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,799
No two are the same.

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,845
You see, they each grant you
a unique ability,

17
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,723
but there's a reason
they're called Devil Fruits.

18
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,101
It's because of the deal you make
when you eat one.

19
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,022
Mother Ocean turns her back on you,
and the sea can take away your strength.

20
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,443
All I know is
that the Gum Gum Fruit is worth more

21
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,070
than all of Shanks's treasure,

22
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,113
and I ate it, so that makes me worth more.

23
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,450
You ever heard,
"There's no such thing as a free lunch?"

24
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,533
Is it lunchtime?

25
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,247
How about you put my chair back together
and I'll see what I can find?

26
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,253
Shanks! You gotta see
what I can do now. Gum Gum...

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,672
Luffy, no!
I'm running out of furniture.

28
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,217
I'd listen to the lady, Luffy. Are these...

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,843
Couple more in the back.

30
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,764
You have to let me join your crew.
I'm tougher than ever.

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,451
Just because you're made of rubber
does not mean you're invincible.

32
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,602
I'll do anything.
I won't take up much space.

33
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,205
Makino came through, Captain.

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,147
Enough supplies
for a few months then some.

35
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,232
Come on, man.

36
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,944
A few months?

37
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,779
Are you going after the One Piece?

38
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,490
- Yeah, as soon as we resupply.
- When will you be back?

39
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,369
We're not coming back.

40
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,003
What did you tell him?

41
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,841
The truth.

42
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,397
Can you not do... that?

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,816
Sorry. It's hard to sit still.

44
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,490
I'm feeling so... so piratey.

45
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,993
Yeah? Well,
you're gonna end up feeling watery

46
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,995
if I have to throw you overboard.

47
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,997
I told you I need absolute silence.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,208
I know. I know. Absolute silence.

49
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,169
It's just that

50
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,548
this is my first real pirate score.

51
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,342
Can you believe that?

52
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,844
Yeah, I can,

53
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,096
because you told me
right after you asked me,

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,307
yet again, to join your crew.

55
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,683
We do make a pretty good team.

56
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,775
Is it open yet?

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,073
No. And can you please give me
some quiet and some space?

58
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,619
Hey.

59
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,746
Not cool.

60
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,916
Don't mess with my hat.

61
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,043
Why do you care so much
about that old thing?

62
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,420
It looks like
you fished it out of the trash.

63
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,672
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

64
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,092
Will you two knock it off?
I'm trying to take a nap.

65
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,279
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were we interrupting your beauty sleep?

66
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,847
Don't like what you see? Look away.

67
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,531
You did it!

68
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,803
That's it? Isn't there supposed to be
gold inside a safe?

69
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,012
Or jewels?

70
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,517
This is more valuable than gold.
It's knowledge.

71
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,520
- This is a map to the Grand Line.
- The Grand Line.

72
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,603
Ah.

73
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,439
The Grand Line is just right...

74
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,109
Where is it exactly?

75
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,278
You're going there,
but you don't know where it is?

76
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,321
Guess I need a navigator on my crew.

77
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,035
The seas are divided into four quadrants.

78
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,665
East Blue, North Blue, West, South.

79
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,793
This thin strip of land
that circles the globe

80
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,753
is called the Red Line,

81
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,590
and this band across the middle
is the Grand Line.

82
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,552
A treacherous stretch of ocean
with bigger islands,

83
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,929
bigger cities, bigger pirates.

84
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,223
Flush with riches
and ripe for the picking.

85
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
And that's where we're gonna find
the One Piece.

86
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,853
I've taken out a lot of pirates
looking for that thing.

87
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,605
What is it?
Like, a big diamond or something?

88
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,982
It's Gold Roger's treasure.

89
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,360
He hid it somewhere in the Grand Line.
All in one piece.

90
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,737
It's a myth.

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,116
The reason no one's found it in 22 years
is that it doesn't exist.

92
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,702
Can't wait to see the look on your face
when we find it.

93
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,789
- Is that the Marines?
- How did they find us?

94
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,843
This smoke smells weird.

95
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,057
Raise...

96
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
Hey.

97
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,605
Zoro.

98
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,450
They took my swords.

99
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,287
And my rucksack, ugh,
with all my navigation gear.

100
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,502
- They didn't take my hat.
- Yeah, small blessings.

101
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,172
Damn it, we've lost the map.

102
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,756
No.

103
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,469
No, we didn't.

104
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,721
It's in a safe place.

105
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,684
Ew. Hey.

106
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,853
Stop. Stop that. Stop that.

107
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,773
- What? I'm trying to find a way out.
- We've been captured. We need a plan.

108
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,819
I don't <i>need</i> a plan. I just need to beat
the hell out of every Marine I see.

109
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,530
Hey, everyone, relax. We're fine.

110
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,826
We're not fine. The Marines
will throw us in jail if we're lucky.

111
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,161
Execute us if they don't.

112
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,829
They... they are not Marines.

113
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,373
Before I got knocked out,
I saw a Jolly Roger.

114
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,501
- We've been captured by pirates.
- That's much better news.

115
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,630
No, he's right. Marines have training.
Pirates are easier to kill.

116
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,800
Shanks used to say not every situation
can be solved with violence.

117
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,010
Who the hell is Shanks?

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,846
We don't need to fight.

119
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,850
I can talk to them. Pirate to pirate.

120
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,933
That won't work.

121
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,687
- Why not?
- To start, you're not a pirate.

122
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,439
- Yes, I am.
- No.

123
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,691
You are some stretchy guy
in a tattered hat.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,943
I'm a different kind of pirate.

125
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,780
Pirates are pirates.
There's only one kind.

126
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,389
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

127
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,024
No. No, no, no, no.

128
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,359
Stop clapping!

129
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,695
No, stop! It's all wrong!

130
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,367
The spotlight was late.
You completely missed my entrance.

131
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,956
And where, oh, where

132
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,791
was the dancing

133
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,001
lion?

134
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,129
Hey, I know you.

135
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,925
I saw your wanted poster in Shells Town.
You're the clown guy.

136
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,218
Um, uh...

137
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,512
- Binky, right?
- Buggy.

138
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,809
Buggy the Clown.

139
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,312
Buggy, the Flashy Fool.

140
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,398
Buggy,

141
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,817
the Genius Jester.

142
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,401
Wow.

143
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,779
You have a lot of names.

144
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,532
I bet everyone in the East Blue
knows who you are.

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,619
What did you just say?

146
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,415
Just that everyone
knows who you are.

147
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,958
Nose?!

148
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,965
Are you making fun of my nose?

149
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,551
Well... I wasn't.

150
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,055
But now that you mention it,
is that thing for real?

151
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,351
What's real is
I've been scheming for months

152
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,314
to steal that map from old Axe-Hand Moron...

153
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,858
Huh?

154
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,401
Eh.

155
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,153
...only to find out

156
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,742
that I was upstaged
by three little nobodies,

157
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,953
who stole it from right out under my no...

158
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,913
No! It's in my head now.

159
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,040
Ah!

160
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,584
Hey, I'm not a nobody.

161
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,961
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

162
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,089
And I will be King of the Pirates.

163
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,343
Oh!

164
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,053
Now that's funny.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,148
My bounty poster

166
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,904
graces the marquee
of every Marine outpost for miles.

167
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,659
And my menagerie of outcasts and freaks

168
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,412
is the most dreaded pirate crew
the East Blue has ever known.

169
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,292
I am destined to find the One Piece.

170
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,460
And when I do...

171
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,924
I will be king.

172
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,467
No, you won't,

173
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,011
'cause I'm gonna find it first.

174
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,596
You? Don't make me laugh.

175
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,602
- I said don't make me laugh!
- All right, listen up.

176
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,897
I'm Roronoa Zoro.

177
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,653
Drop your weapons now
and I may let you live.

178
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,701
Ladies and gentlemen,

179
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,414
we have a celebrity in our midst.

180
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,582
Too bad I hate sharing the spotlight.

181
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,839
Now, maybe we should skip
right to the finale.

182
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,845
My freaks put quite a bit of rehearsal
time into this little abduction.

183
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,932
And if I can't reward them with that map...

184
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,231
I suppose I'll have to offer them
a pound of flesh instead.

185
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,568
Wait. Wait. What if I have
something else to offer you?

186
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,028
Something more valuable than the map?

187
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,366
What if I give you
a new freak for your crew?

188
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,912
A rare talent. The most spectacular act
in all of the East Blue.

189
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,956
Besides you, of course.

190
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,417
Go on.

191
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,921
Hey!

192
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,775
Oh my God.

193
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,365
Get...

194
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,375
What did you do?

195
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,296
What did you do to their town?
You destroyed everything!

196
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,881
Not everything.

197
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,593
I let 'em keep their hands.

198
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,305
Okay.

199
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,268
Here end the theatrics.

200
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,398
I know one of you has my map,
and I'm gonna get it back.

201
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,568
What was it you said, Rubber Boy?
That it was in a safe place?

202
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,987
Don't look so surprised.

203
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,698
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

204
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,371
So please make our guests uncomfortable
in the green room.

205
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:06,971
I am gonna have a chat
with my stretchy new pal.

206
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,946
Hut!

207
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,286
Who's that?

208
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,289
Don't you know anything?

209
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,085
That's Vice-Admiral Garp.
Hero of the Marines.

210
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,421
The man that captured Gold Roger.

211
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,923
The attack came
without warning, sir.

212
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,468
The vicious Devil Fruit eater and his crew
stormed the base,

213
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,053
killing innocent Marines.

214
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,181
Turns out they had help
from a network of traitors.

215
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,642
- That's not what happened.
- Sh! No talking.

216
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:59,064
They would've overrun the base. Once
they saw my axe, they ran off in fear.

217
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,736
Was that before or after you let them
steal a map to the Grand Line?

218
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,487
That was regrettable.

219
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,701
I had to make a decision
and opted for the welfare of my Marines.

220
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,078
It's a good thing
they had you at the helm.

221
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,252
What steps are you taking
to apprehend these pirates?

222
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,504
Well, we're scouring the surrounding seas.

223
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,423
Of course, they wouldn't have gotten away

224
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,760
if my useless son
had been able to prevent their escape.

225
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,971
He probably would've been killed

226
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,933
if not for the bravery
of our newly-enlisted cadet.

227
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,360
- Newly enlisted?
- Just this morning. Sir.

228
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,906
Make no mistake, sir, I won't rest

229
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:54,286
until I have every one of those pirates
hanging in my yard.

230
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,793
Give it a rest.
Those ropes are too strong, even for you.

231
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,461
I've got out of worse.

232
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,466
When I ran out of the tent,
I... saw a town or...

233
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,346
what was left of one
after Buggy destroyed it.

234
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,229
You mean, when you tried
to leave us for dead?

235
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,935
We were surrounded and unarmed.
You were picking a fight you couldn't win.

236
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,258
I know your type.
If there's nothing to gain, you're out.

237
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:25,234
Says the wandering bounty hunter,
trading lives for a handful of Berry.

238
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,957
- I serve a purpose.
- Sure you do.

239
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,324
- I think I can get us out of here.
- You mean get yourself out of here.

240
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,327
That's fair, but I'm going
to need you to trust me.

241
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,847
Just like a thief to lie to my face
and ask me to believe her.

242
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,540
You got any other options?

243
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,838
Fine. Just tell me what we're gonna do.

244
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,215
What we've been doing.

245
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,802
- Waiting to make sure we're alone.
- You have a lock pick?

246
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,595
I have four lock picks.

247
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,265
The clowns only found three.

248
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,940
Better work faster.

249
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,369
I want you to think of this
like an artistic exercise,

250
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,832
because pain leads to art.

251
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,378
And art reveals truth.

252
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,132
But there's only one truth
I need from this exercise.

253
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,675
Where

254
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,719
is

255
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,596
my...

256
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,391
map?

257
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,684
Truthfully?

258
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,813
I'm... I'm kind of hungry.

259
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,025
Don't circuses have cotton candy?

260
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,577
What could you possibly
need that map for anyway?

261
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,623
You wouldn't last five minutes
in the Grand Line.

262
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,334
I already told you.
I'm gonna be King of the Pir...

263
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,417
Boring!

264
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,502
Let's go another ten feet.

265
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,262
You can stretch me all you want.

266
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,640
I can do this all day.

267
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,571
I'm not asking the right questions.

268
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,395
We need to go deeper,
get you out of your comfort zone.

269
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:32,486
What makes a boy want to grow up
to be King of the Pirates?

270
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,905
Who are you trying to impress?

271
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,116
A lost love?

272
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,034
An absent parent?

273
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,495
Or was it someone

274
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,747
that you worshiped?

275
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,831
A false idol.

276
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,377
That's it.

277
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,714
Hey, give me back my hat!

278
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,717
I used to know a pirate
that wore a hat just like this.

279
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,054
Red-Haired Shanks.

280
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,973
You knew Shanks?

281
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,891
Ginger? Three scars, left eye?

282
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,938
We served together on a pirate crew
when we were about your age.

283
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,108
For a time,
I even thought we were friends.

284
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,819
Until he betrayed me.

285
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:20,325
Just like all the others.

286
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,372
He wanted to keep <i>me</i> out of the spotlight!

287
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:30,377
He wanted to keep my star
from shining too brightly!

288
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,219
Is that what he did to you, Rubber Boy?

289
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,640
Did Shanks betray you too?

290
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,767
Don't talk about him that way.

291
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,269
Ah.

292
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:52,232
Now we are finally getting to the truth.

293
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,903
Stretch him until he breaks.

294
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,030
Please, don't make me do this.

295
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,533
I invite you

296
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,331
to take part
in the splendor that is my show

297
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,625
and this is how you repay me?

298
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,752
With a "no"?

299
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,754
You've destroyed our town.

300
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,757
Made us your prisoners. Isn't that enough?

301
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,718
Well, maybe you'd prefer it

302
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,181
if I threw one of your constituents
on the rack instead.

303
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,726
Hey, kid!

304
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,772
You want to get tall fast?

305
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,276
Boogie, I'm warning you.

306
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,403
It's Buggy!

307
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,530
And you're warning me?

308
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,282
Now that's a laugh.

309
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,870
I said that's a laugh.

310
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,103
- Put him down.
- But why?

311
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,022
He's having such a great time.

312
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,691
Aren't you, junior?

313
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,944
Yes. The best, Buggy.

314
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,282
- Gum Gum...
- Ugh.

315
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,950
...Pistol!

316
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,376
Hi.

317
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,171
Well, well, well,

318
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,176
looks like we have
something else in common.

319
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
You ate a Devil Fruit?

320
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,725
The Chop Chop Fruit.

321
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,522
So you can slice me and you can dice me,

322
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:01,737
but I'll always put myself
back together again.

323
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,411
Want to see what else I can do?

324
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,561
- What?
- This is my life now.

325
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,937
You want to trade places?

326
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,025
Someone's coming.

327
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,070
I need more time. Keep them talking.

328
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,613
I don't talk. I hit things.

329
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,669
- Remember me?
- No.

330
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,256
Must be some other
homicidal, unicycle-riding clown.

331
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,182
I've been thinking about you for years.

332
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,062
About how you killed my brother.

333
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,567
I killed a lot of pirates.

334
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
My name is Cabaji,

335
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,448
and a couple of years ago,
you hunted us across the Goa Kingdom.

336
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,159
Followed us for weeks
through the swamp lands,

337
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,453
day and night, never relenting,

338
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,955
like some kind of demon.

339
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,921
Still not ringing a bell.

340
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,470
You cut off his head
and you stuffed it in a bag,

341
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,764
all for a few Berry.

342
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,269
Okay, that does sound like me.

343
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,277
Let's see if you can keep your head.

344
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,888
Come in, cadet. Have a seat.

345
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,097
Yes, sir.

346
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,531
Something wrong with your uniform, son?

347
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,615
No, sir.

348
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,579
- It's just a little too big.
- Are you sure that's all it is, cadet?

349
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,876
The Marine insignia,
it's not for everyone, you know.

350
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,212
It's only my first day, sir.

351
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,591
That's not what this is about.

352
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,097
We both know you don't belong here.

353
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,434
Being a Marine, it's all I've ever wanted.

354
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,354
And I want to believe you,
but your story doesn't add up.

355
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,437
Sir...

356
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,284
How long have you been working
with the pirates who attacked this base?

357
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,203
What? No, sir. I'm not.

358
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,247
You were seen with one of them

359
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,749
at the local tavern.

360
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,001
Time to start telling the truth,
cadet.

361
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,589
Or we'll have you hanging
on one of those crosses out in the yard.

362
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,849
I was held captive
by a pirate named Alvida.

363
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,810
I was her prisoner.

364
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,061
It was horrible.

365
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,609
- Then he saved me.
- Who?

366
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,861
Luffy.

367
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,156
The Straw Hat Pirate?

368
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,159
You say his name is...

369
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
is Luffy?

370
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,582
Yes, sir.

371
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,886
What's your part in all this?

372
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,184
- Why are you pretending to be a Marine?
- I'm not pretending.

373
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
Being a Marine is my dream.

374
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:51,067
Marines make the world a better place.
One where people can feel safe.

375
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,361
That's what I told Luffy.

376
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,531
- And he set me free.
- Did he now?

377
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,619
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

378
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,871
I was worried they wouldn't let me enlist.

379
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,833
Then my dream would be over.

380
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,349
Telling the truth

381
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,518
is a core value of the Marines.

382
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,481
- Isn't that right, Bogard?
- Yes, sir.

383
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,153
One that seems to be lacking
at this particular base.

384
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,321
One last question.

385
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,781
This, uh,

386
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,409
Straw Hat Pirate...

387
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,246
do you owe him any allegiance?

388
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,127
He's a pirate.

389
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,175
Pirates should face justice.

390
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,386
Good.

391
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,975
Then we'll find him together.

392
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,443
All right, here we go!

393
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,327
I know you're upset,
but you should eat something.

394
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,496
I'm not hungry.

395
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,833
You're never not hungry. What's going on?

396
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,503
I thought this shithole
was supposed to be popular.

397
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,338
We never got our drinks.

398
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,592
We are still very, very thirsty.

399
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,218
Get out!

400
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,638
You're not welcome here.

401
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,974
You made a fool out of Shanks!

402
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,642
You said something, brat?

403
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:52,397
You want to talk like a man, you better
be ready to back it up like a man.

404
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,735
- Let me go!
- Please stop. He's just a boy.

405
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,530
He's just a boy who needs to learn
respect for his betters.

406
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,990
Good luck.

407
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,660
I've been trying
to teach him that for months.

408
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,744
Shanks?

409
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,499
Look, boys, the janitor is back.

410
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,710
Just as I was about to make a mess.

411
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,670
Put him down.

412
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,796
This little shit?

413
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,133
You're lucky I don't slit his throat.

414
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,303
You can spill a drink on me
and I'll let it slide.

415
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,682
But don't you ever threaten my friends.

416
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,363
Kill them.

417
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,604
Get some.

418
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,421
Where's Luffy?

419
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,624
Don't bother. It's seawater.

420
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,669
Ah!

421
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,754
Hardly seems fair.

422
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,425
All those wonderful powers
rendered useless from a few splashes.

423
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,553
Of course, you could always give me my map

424
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,472
if you don't want to die
alone in this tank.

425
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,599
My crew...

426
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,852
Your crew?

427
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,938
You mean the ones that abandoned you?

428
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,065
Just like Shanks did.

429
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,861
Oh, did that make you sad?

430
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,322
They will come back for me.

431
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,823
No one's coming for you.

432
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,287
Your only chance is to turn over that map,
and if you do,

433
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,834
I may have a very special place on my crew

434
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,210
just for you.

435
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,594
Never!

436
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,180
Why not?

437
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,181
Ah!

438
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,098
God!

439
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,979
You're an outcast,
just like the rest of us.

440
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,274
A freak, scorned and abandoned!

441
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,029
Join me...

442
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,575
and you can serve the man

443
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,829
who will become the King of the Pirates.

444
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,084
When I have that map,

445
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,379
I will find the One Piece,

446
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,215
and then everyone will know my name.

447
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
And they'll love me.

448
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,847
You can't make people love you.

449
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,976
Just like you can't make them smile.

450
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,690
I'll never give you that map.

451
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,816
Well, then...

452
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,570
I guess it's curtains for you.

453
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,790
<i>Shanks is gonna grind you up
and make bandit sausage.</i>

454
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,460
- You're gonna wish you were never born.
- Believe me, I wish that already.

455
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,588
He's gonna kick your ass.
There's nowhere you can hide.

456
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,007
Enough, brat!

457
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,884
You really think anyone is coming for you?

458
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,345
They don't care.

459
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,474
And no one...

460
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,021
no one is gonna miss you when you're dead.

461
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,745
Luffy, can you hear me?

462
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,013
Ah! Shanks!

463
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,032
Get lost.

464
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,721
Come here.

465
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,275
No.

466
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,112
Shanks, your arm!

467
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,029
It's my fault.

468
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,576
- It's all my fault!
- It's only an arm.

469
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,288
I'm just glad that you're okay.

470
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,593
- Don't touch my hat!
- What was that?

471
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,971
I... I couldn't hear you
over all the drowning.

472
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,150
You really don't fear death, do you?

473
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,110
No. I just don't fear you.

474
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,282
You know, I'm gonna enjoy this.

475
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,619
As soon as Captain Buggy's finished
with you, you're mine.

476
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,330
Uh, tempting as that sounds,
I'm not sticking around.

477
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,624
Really? Got somewhere else to be?

478
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,294
Didn't used to think so.

479
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,006
But Luffy changed that.

480
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,719
That simpleton in a straw hat.
Don't tell me you actually believe in him?

481
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,597
I don't need to. He believes in himself.

482
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,475
It rubs off.

483
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,562
And one more thing.

484
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,563
Don't turn around.

485
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,494
What's the plan?

486
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,750
You do have a plan, right?
That's your thing, plans.

487
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,334
I say

488
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,714
we beat the hell
out of every clown we see.

489
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,475
You want out?
You know the price you have to pay.

490
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,365
Where are my freaks?

491
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,868
They're not coming.

492
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,809
My map!

493
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,270
My hat.

494
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,753
You want a piece of me?
Let's see what you got.

495
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,510
Surprise, shithead!

496
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,400
How do I slice a guy
who's already in pieces?

497
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,194
This is not part of the plan.

498
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,418
Ah!

499
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,348
Ah.

500
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,808
Would you look at that?

501
00:39:54,892 --> 00:40:00,147
Somebody escaped my Tank of Doom.

502
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,150
Well, I'll be back to finish you off.

503
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,571
Right after I tear apart
your sad excuse for a crew.

504
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,283
You can dump seawater on me,

505
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,994
and I'll let it slide.

506
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,544
But don't you ever threaten my friends.

507
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,895
So you want to die first?

508
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,897
Be my guest.

509
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:53,325
Chop-Chop Cannon!

510
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,121
Ah!

511
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,925
Ah!

512
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,973
Ah!

513
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,936
Nami! The crates!

514
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,166
Damn it!

515
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,304
What have you done to me?

516
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,056
Cut you down to size.

517
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,518
The One Piece will never be yours.

518
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:08,108
You're just a sad, lonely little boy
wearing another man's hat!

519
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,736
I know exactly who I am.

520
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,409
I am Monkey D. Luffy.

521
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,997
And I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

522
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,793
Gum Gum...

523
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,087
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

524
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,213
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

525
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,632
Bazooka!

526
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,481
You're giving this to me?

527
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,358
You're the navigator.

528
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,529
Let's get out of this clown show.

529
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,824
Still one more thing we have to do.

530
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,839
Are you our new captors?

531
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,632
What?

532
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,968
Well, you're a pirate, aren't you?

533
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,388
I'm a different kind of pirate.

534
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,858
My fellow Marines,

535
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:38,616
corruption rots like old fruit,
spoiling all it touches.

536
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,745
The men and women of this base
have not failed the Marines.

537
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,665
But their leadership has.

538
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,548
Since the execution of Gold Roger,

539
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,219
we have been fighting
an unending war against piracy,

540
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,680
but we are not fighting the right battle.

541
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:06,810
We can take their ships,
their weapons, and even their lives,

542
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:12,483
but we cannot win
if we do not take away their dreams.

543
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,694
This is why I am personally
leading a mission

544
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,614
to hunt down
the pirates who attacked this base.

545
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,950
And I am taking
this squadron of new cadets with me.

546
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:27,289
Together, we will show these pirates,
and all pirates,

547
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,459
that there are consequences
for their actions,

548
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,170
and we are that consequence.

549
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,424
For honor.

550
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,509
For honor!

551
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,344
- For justice.
- For justice!

552
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,512
For the Marines.

553
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,930
For the Marines!

554
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,564
We don't have much,

555
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:58,737
but please, take this
as a token of our... of our gratitude.

556
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,823
You need it more than we do.

557
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,876
Well...

558
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,631
maybe just a snack.

559
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,346
- Bye.
- Bye.

560
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,432
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.

561
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,310
Bye. Thank you.

562
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:41,655
Thank you all for your hospitality
and the food and the drink.

563
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,240
We'll savor it as long as we can.

564
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,326
And with Lucky Roux,
that should be about three hours.

565
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,162
If you're lucky!

566
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,186
I think I'll miss you most of all, Luffy.

567
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,064
You were right, Shanks.

568
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,735
Back when you wouldn't let me
join your crew.

569
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,447
- I'm not ready.
- Luffy...

570
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,865
But when I am,

571
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,951
I'm gonna be a pirate captain

572
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,956
with my own ship and a crew
that will always have each other's backs.

573
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,251
We're gonna be the greatest pirates
the world has ever seen.

574
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,504
Even greater than your crew.

575
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,967
I'm gonna find the One Piece
and become King of the Pirates!

576
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,053
Greater than even us, huh?

577
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,687
Well, in that case...

578
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:05,906
This hat is the most precious thing I own.
It means the world to me.

579
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,369
And I want you to take it.

580
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,588
When we meet again,
you can give it back to me.

581
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,008
But only after you become a great pirate.

582
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,511
That'll be our promise.

583
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,185
Be good, Luffy.

584
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,888
Almost finished.

585
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,104
You fixed it.

586
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,568
Thanks.

587
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,653
Well, you said
it was your treasure, right?

588
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,790
Is every day gonna be this crazy with you?

589
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,594
Shanks always said...

590
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,432
that if the path to what you want
seems too easy...

591
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,186
then you're on the wrong path.

592
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,524
This Shanks guy sounds all right.

593
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,867
Next stop,

594
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,703
the Grand Line!

595
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,823
It's me.

596
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,078
You can tell him I have the map.
