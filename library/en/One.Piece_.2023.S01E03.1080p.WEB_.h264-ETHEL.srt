1
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,975
The pirates are coming!
The pirates are coming!

2
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,102
Pirates!

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,064
Clear the streets!

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,444
The pirates are coming!
They're here! Take cover!

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,320
- Pirates!
- Pirates!

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,910
They're here!
They're coming for all of us!

7
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,956
- The pirates are coming!
- He's gotta stop.

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,351
- Everybody, run!
- Not this again.

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,215
- Go inside!
- Every day, this kid.

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,422
Pirates! The pirates are coming!

11
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,508
They're attacking the village!
Pirates! Pirates!

12
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,803
Pirates. Man the cannons!
Batten the hatches!

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,388
Oh!

14
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,724
I'll batten your hatches, you idiot!

15
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,894
{\an8}Fear not! No pirate will get past me.

16
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,938
{\an8}There are no pirates.
Haven't been in years.

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,150
{\an8}That's where you're wrong.
I know they're coming any day now.

18
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,737
But fear not,
the Great Captain Usopp will protect you.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,574
When are you gonna stop
wasting your life, Usopp? It's pathetic.

20
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,328
The pirates are coming! Pirates! Pirates!

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,538
The pirates are coming! They're coming!

22
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,975
Never seen that before.

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,059
Hey, Nami.

24
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,813
- Nami!
- What?

25
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,026
It's ready!

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,570
And what is it?

27
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:58,034
Our Jolly Roger. Every pirate crew
has to have one. And now we do!

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,411
We're not a crew,
and you are not hanging that on my boat.

29
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,456
Zoro! Zoro, check it out.

30
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,001
That's unique.

31
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,632
Nami, I think the toilet's busted.

32
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,384
We don't have a toilet.

33
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,928
Oh.

34
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,721
Well, then something back there's leaking.

35
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,805
What?

36
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,187
No!

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,951
Shit.

38
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,414
- We're taking in water. What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

39
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,257
They way you're clanging
those swords around,

40
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,451
you must've broken something.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,586
Maybe you should've stolen
a better boat.

42
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,714
Guys. Guys. Guys. Okay, crew meeting.

43
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,923
- Not a crew!
- Not a crew.

44
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,218
We're gonna need a better ship
to make it to the Grand Line.

45
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,304
A real pirate ship.

46
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,973
Worthy of the Straw Hat Crew.

47
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,518
- Wait. Straw Hat Crew? Really?
- Yeah, I thought it had a nice ring to it.

48
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,187
"Demon" has a nice ring to it.

49
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,273
- Headgear? Not scary.
- Who says pirates have to be scary?

50
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,903
The point is we need a new ship.

51
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,863
So where do we get one?

52
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,411
Our closest bet is the Gecko Islands.

53
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,289
We can probably make it there
before our ship sinks.

54
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,041
Ditch this one and get a better one.

55
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,792
Good. With a working toilet.

56
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,086
Great job, navigator.

57
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,590
You're still not hanging that on my ship.

58
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,607
Get down that rigging!

59
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,108
Aye, sir!

60
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,861
- Double time!
- You heard him! Double time!

61
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,199
Cadets had better prove yourself
if you're gonna sail under me.

62
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,662
The pirates who attacked Shells Town
have a head start.

63
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,582
But once I sink my teeth in,

64
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,917
I don't let go.

65
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,587
Am I understood, Marines?

66
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,838
Aye, sir!

67
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,138
Why did I have to get
dragged along for this?

68
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,058
Mm-mmm.

69
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,229
Hey. Move.

70
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,982
I said move.

71
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,277
You too, cadet.

72
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,367
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I already tied that knot.

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,827
Your knot would've slipped.

74
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,037
I was just trying to...

75
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,539
Just trying to show me up.

76
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,584
You think you can do anything I can't do?

77
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,668
No.

78
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,673
- I was just... I was trying to, like, help.
- Cadets.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,512
Which one of you secured this rigging?

80
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,096
He did, sir.

81
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,224
Is that true?

82
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,769
Yes.

83
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,479
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,606
Hmm.

85
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,571
It's a fine knot, son.

86
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,991
You've spent time at sea?

87
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,077
Yes, sir. I have.

88
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,855
Why don't you come with me?

89
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,585
Leave all this drilling
to the raw recruits.

90
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,671
Uh, sir? What about me?

91
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,506
Find a rope and practice.

92
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,092
I would've hoped
your father would've taught you better.

93
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,356
You got to be kidding me.

94
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,941
That clown was worth 15 million Berry.

95
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,403
We should've stuffed his head in a bag
and brought it with us.

96
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,697
What Marine would pay you
that bounty anyway?

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,368
You're kind of a wanted man yourself now.

98
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,452
Hmm.

99
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,121
Didn't think of that.

100
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,047
All the more reason
to get to the Grand Line. Fresh start!

101
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Right.

102
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,928
Hey! You got us a ship?

103
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,723
Working on it. Did you push the sloop
out to sea like I told you?

104
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,850
Yeah. No Marines
are gonna be following us here.

105
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,369
Well, we're not gonna be here very long.

106
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,190
Turns out Syrup Village
is known for their ship building.

107
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,400
Lots of options.

108
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,652
Well, what are we waiting for then?

109
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,905
Uh...

110
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,202
Stupid clown.

111
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:04,966
Wait till I get my hands
on that rubber-hose little runt.

112
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,554
Nobody makes a fool of Buggy the Clown!

113
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,935
Well, it's about time
one of my sorry excuses

114
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,187
for a supporting cast showed up.

115
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,189
Now get out of my light!

116
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,026
Buggy the Clown.

117
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,369
We're closed.

118
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,830
Show's on hiatus.

119
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,917
Arlong wants a word.

120
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,049
Well, you can tell Arlong...

121
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,887
that I don't take requests.

122
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,365
Look at 'em all.

123
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,096
- How much do these cost?
- If you have to ask, you can't afford it.

124
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,374
Okay, so we need to get one
with a very, very impressive figurehead.

125
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,626
At least two...

126
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,171
No, no, three masts!
And a really high crow's nest.

127
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,774
We are not gonna be able
to sail a ship anywhere near that size.

128
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,175
There's only three of us.

129
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,719
Three of us right now.

130
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,014
Well, unless you can find
another weird, desperate soul to help us.

131
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,432
Speak for yourself.

132
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,269
Listen. We are going to need
something a little less flashy

133
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,021
if we want to sneak out of here.

134
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,732
You want to steal a ship?

135
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,610
How else did you expect us to get one?

136
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,947
I don't know. But we can't steal one.

137
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,490
What kind of pirate are you?

138
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,495
A ship is not just a ship.
It's a part of our crew.

139
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,249
We need to find the perfect one.
And we're gonna get it the right way.

140
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,335
Okay, pitch that to the salesman.
I'm sure that'll win him over.

141
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,503
Exactly.

142
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,509
So what are we actually gonna do?

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,054
Find a ship and see how lax
the security is around here.

144
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,265
Got it.

145
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,357
Real beauty, huh?

146
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,652
You can talk?

147
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,155
No! Over here.

148
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,489
Yo.

149
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,201
This ship is amazing.

150
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,285
Yeah.

151
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,371
What can you tell me about her?

152
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,709
Caravel class, top-of-the-line.
Ninety-six feet of pure luxury.

153
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,711
Whipstaff rudder, full galley.

154
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,796
Cannon decks fore and aft.

155
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,174
Is she fast?

156
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,091
The fastest.

157
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,802
Not a ship in the East Blue
can keep up with this baby.

158
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,264
She's perfect!

159
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,682
You can say that again.

160
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,352
There you are.

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Guys!

162
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,150
I found it.

163
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,819
I found our ship.

164
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,238
And this guy will sell it to us.

165
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,117
Uh, wait. What? Uh...

166
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,036
Yeah! The ship, we'll take it.

167
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:07,249
- Technically, she's not for sale.
- Huh?

168
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
And technically,

169
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,004
I'm not a salesman.

170
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,799
- Do you even work here?
- Of course I do.

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,717
I'm Chief Technician

172
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,637
in charge of encrustation removal
and aviary waste eradication.

173
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Encru what?

174
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,225
- He scrubs barnacles and cleans bird shit.
- He can't help us.

175
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,727
Wait! Wait! Wait! I can help you.

176
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,565
The owner of this ship just happens to be
my closest friend in the world.

177
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,484
Your friend owns this ship?

178
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,028
Not just this one.
She owns the whole shipyard.

179
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,155
She's <i>rich</i> rich.

180
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,239
Oh!

181
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,575
I'm sure you could strike a deal with her.

182
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,868
See?

183
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,165
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to say hello.

184
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,878
What the hell did I do with it?

185
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,384
Sir... is there something
I can help you with?

186
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,847
You've quite a handle
on basic seamanship.

187
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,225
You learn that
on that pirate ship of yours?

188
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,935
Yes, sir.

189
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,899
I was forced to work alongside the crew.
They'd lock me in the bilge if I didn't.

190
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,363
Our experiences don't define us.

191
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,158
It's what we gain from them that matters.

192
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,910
You learned, and you survived.

193
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,913
Oh. Oh.

194
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,459
Here it is.

195
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,546
You play?

196
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,008
- A little, sir.
- Good.

197
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,572
Let's see if you
can do more than tie knots.

198
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,791
I've never seen
a house this big before.

199
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,209
Impressive, right?

200
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,420
Kaya's given me an open invitation
to drop by anytime I want.

201
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,504
Wow.

202
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,673
All of this just for one person?

203
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,010
Well, she lives here
with her butler and a few other staff.

204
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,849
Money really shows you
who people truly are.

205
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,436
Most people only care about themselves
and what's theirs.

206
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,897
Sounds like someone I know.

207
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,193
And a small staff
makes for easy pickings.

208
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,155
Why? Gonna rob the place blind?

209
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,408
At least a little blurry.

210
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,581
So if you have an invitation,
why are we going around the back way?

211
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,225
I never use the front entrance.

212
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,294
This is more of a VIP entrance
reserved for special guests.

213
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,618
This guy's full of shit.

214
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,216
Yeah. But as long as he gets us
inside the house, who cares?

215
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,430
Oops. You know, there's actually
a more exclusive entrance this way.

216
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,981
- The hell are you doing here, Usopp?
- Buchi, buddy, uh, Kaya's expecting me.

217
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,235
- Another one of your lies.
- Oh.

218
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,446
- You ain't welcome here and you know it.
- I know nothing of the sort.

219
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm here to give Kaya
an extra-special gift.

220
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,575
Usopp!

221
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,293
What a wonderful surprise.

222
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,589
Hmm!

223
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,715
Kaya!

224
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Happy birthday.

225
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
- You remembered.
- Of course I did.

226
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,269
Usopp.

227
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,566
We've had this discussion.
You mustn't show up unannounced.

228
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,151
Nonsense, Klahadore.

229
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,615
Have you come to tell me another story?
I do love hearing about your adventures.

230
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,492
I'll do you one better.
I brought some of my crew.

231
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,369
Is he talking about us?

232
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,581
It's so nice to meet you.
You all must stay for dinner.

233
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,374
Miss Kaya,

234
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
it is a bit last minute.

235
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,714
I'm afraid the kitchen
hasn't prepared for any extra guests.

236
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,050
Please, Klahadore.

237
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,885
It's my birthday.

238
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,346
Can't be too much trouble, can it?

239
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,725
Of course, Miss Kaya.

240
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,644
Anything for you.

241
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,563
All right! When do we eat?

242
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,399
You don't. Not dressed like that.

243
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:48,238
Sham, kindly show Usopp
and his friends to the guest suites.

244
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,951
You will bathe and change before dinner.

245
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,452
Hmm.

246
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,956
A bath does sound nice.

247
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,251
All right!

248
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,686
Yo.

249
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,066
One of these days,
Klahadore is going to figure out

250
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,777
you use the servant's passageways
to sneak in here.

251
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,654
Uh, uh.

252
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,239
So what if he does?

253
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,700
I'll find another way in.

254
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,285
What are you doing here anyway?
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

255
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,622
I wanted to give you
your birthday present.

256
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,877
Uh...

257
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,343
It's, um...

258
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,638
A giant pearl!

259
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,223
So it is.

260
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,934
It wasn't easy to get either.

261
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,187
It was guarded
by a giant goldfish monster.

262
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,192
I had to weather a storm,
my ship almost capsizing, to find it.

263
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,485
Whoa!

264
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,530
Phew!

265
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,157
I barely made landfall.

266
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,577
Only it wasn't land I was on.

267
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
It was...

268
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,497
...a massive piece

269
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,042
of goldfish shit.

270
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,669
Ew!

271
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,924
Kaya, are you okay?

272
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,384
Tea.

273
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,158
How have you been feeling lately?

274
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,369
No different really.

275
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,874
When you've been sick as long as I have,
you get used to it.

276
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,755
This tea is the only thing
that makes me feel better.

277
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,968
That and your stories, of course.

278
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,137
Well,

279
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,601
I'll keep going on these grand adventures
as long as you want to hear 'em.

280
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,771
I wouldn't miss them for the world.

281
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,610
Why would anyone
even need this many clothes?

282
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,737
It's not about need
with these people.

283
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,988
It's about want.

284
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
What are we even supposed to wear?

285
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,868
Anything you want.

286
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,705
When are you ever going to get
the opportunity to wear things this nice?

287
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,666
Well?

288
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,710
What do you think?

289
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,799
You look like Nami.

290
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,890
Hey, Zoro!

291
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,517
What you gonna wear?

292
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,855
Something black.

293
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,231
How edgy.

294
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,611
Hey, does that butler
seem familiar to you guys?

295
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,489
Yeah, I think he was
at the last dinner party I attended.

296
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,324
I swear I've seen him somewhere.

297
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,249
How's this?

298
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,127
- Still Nami.
- I said I'm wearing black.

299
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,004
I hate you guys.

300
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,256
I feel kind of bad for Kaya.

301
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,759
All this stuff.

302
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,178
All this space.

303
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,098
It's gotta make a person feel... lonely.

304
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,309
Rich people don't have
the same emotions we do.

305
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:49,188
This stuff doesn't make her feel lonely.
It makes her feel important.

306
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,733
Well, Usopp likes her.

307
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,526
And she invited us to dinner.

308
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,821
I'm sure we can work out
a way to get that ship.

309
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,408
No way. Rich people don't stay rich
by giving things away.

310
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,243
You want to bet?

311
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,832
What are the terms?

312
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,504
I bet I can convince Kaya
to give us that ship.

313
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,714
And when you can't?

314
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,467
We go with your plan.

315
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,969
Steal one and move on.

316
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,472
You're on.

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Nice.

318
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,704
Eighteen years old.
I can hardly believe it.

319
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,582
You've grown into a fine young woman,
Miss Kaya.

320
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,501
Oh, Klahadore.

321
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,887
You know, I had nothing
when your parents took me in.

322
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,973
When they passed, well,

323
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,351
let's just say it has been an honor

324
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,728
to repay their kindness, and yours,

325
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,147
by serving you these past three years.

326
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,902
You do so much for me.

327
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,613
And not as a butler. As a friend.

328
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,702
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

329
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,747
I know I can be
a tad overprotective at times,

330
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,625
but it's just because
I couldn't bear to think

331
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,295
what I would do
were something to happen to you.

332
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,423
You could lighten up just a bit.

333
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,386
I shall try.

334
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,889
That could be my birthday gift to you.

335
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,692
Careful, you idiot!

336
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,196
Sorry. It's a chef's reflex.

337
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,948
You want to poison yourself?

338
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,285
And how are
the dinner preparations coming along?

339
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,912
Uh... fine, sir.

340
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,467
Sham?

341
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,310
What is this?

342
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,190
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

343
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,817
No. It won't.

344
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:52,079
Everything must be perfect,
tonight of all nights, hmm?

345
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,020
Still your move, son.

346
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,814
Sorry, sir.

347
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,955
Game.

348
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,706
You're overthinking things, son.

349
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,460
You're too focused on not losing.

350
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,880
You won't win wars
if you keep playing defensive.

351
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,134
- I'm not very good, sir.
- Nonsense.

352
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,636
You just keep getting in your own way.

353
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,846
Now,

354
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,391
two minutes.

355
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,150
Right. Your move.

356
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,151
Do it.

357
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,756
I won!

358
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,012
That you did.

359
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,474
Because you acted decisively.

360
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,058
It's the same with pirates.

361
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,394
Action is the only language
they understand,

362
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,271
so we need to speak it louder.

363
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,192
Especially with these young upstarts.

364
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,653
They need a swift hand to put them
back in their place. Understood?

365
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,782
- Yes, sir.
- Clear the board. We go again.

366
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,246
Ah.

367
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,831
Mmm.

368
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,501
These are so good.

369
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,919
I know, right?

370
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,755
Reminds me of that one time
I slayed a dragon,

371
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,050
cooked it over an open flame,
ate the whole thing myself.

372
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,760
- You ever had dragon?
- Nope.

373
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,763
- Do you have dragon?
- Afraid we're fresh out.

374
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Oh well.

375
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,894
Hey, Zoro. You gotta try this!

376
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,811
Mmm.

377
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,730
I've got all I need right here.

378
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,823
So you manage
all of Kaya's finances?

379
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,741
Oh yes.

380
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:39,287
I've handled her family's accounts,
both personal and professional, for years.

381
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,205
Fascinating.

382
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,333
You know, I've always been interested

383
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,294
in learning about the intricacies
of the shipbuilding business.

384
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,658
Oh.

385
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,549
May I present...

386
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,344
Miss Kaya.

387
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,321
Kaya, you look absolutely radiant.

388
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,158
Merry, I'm so glad you could make it.

389
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,161
This is a milestone
I wouldn't miss for the world.

390
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,915
Your parents would be so proud.

391
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,757
- Nami, I love that dress on you.
- Thanks.

392
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,969
It belonged to my mother.
It was one of her favorites.

393
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,139
- Oh, I'm sorry. I...
- Not at all.

394
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,726
I'm sure she would agree
it suits you splendidly.

395
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,150
Have we met before?

396
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,778
You look familiar.

397
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,116
Highly doubtful, sir.

398
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,659
Funky Bar?

399
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,661
Mirror Ball Island?

400
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,873
Funky Bar?

401
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,086
Well, I can assure you I've never
patronized that type of establishment.

402
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,131
Kaya, I wonder if I might have your ear?

403
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:17,093
There are matters concerning
the transfer of ownership of the shipyard

404
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,386
we need to discuss.

405
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,599
Merry, dear friend,
it's always business with you.

406
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,519
Tonight is about celebration.

407
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,688
Shall we all move to the dining room?

408
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,231
Yes!

409
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,943
Oh! Oh, I'm so ready for this...

410
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,749
- Keep this coming.
- Uh.

411
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,381
I'd love to try the fish tonight.

412
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,842
I'm sorry, Miss Kaya,
but that is not possible.

413
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,719
Maybe just a small piece?

414
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,473
Now, you know that certain foods
can affect your constitution.

415
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,601
Here, Buchi has prepared
your special soup.

416
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,402
Kaya, it's your birthday.
You should be able to eat what you want.

417
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,864
Miss Kaya's medical condition necessitates
that I closely monitor her dietary needs.

418
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,491
Does it mean you also speak for her?

419
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,202
I'll take her fish.

420
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,101
Luffy, isn't there something
that you wanted to talk to Kaya about?

421
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,379
Oh, yes! Usopp told me
that you own the whole shipyard.

422
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,841
Well, actually my parents
founded the shipyard,

423
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,343
and Merry's been
running the business since...

424
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,721
well, since they passed.

425
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,057
But all of that's about to change.

426
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,688
Tonight, at midnight,
I will become the sole owner.

427
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:58,027
Ah. Well, that's great,
because we want to buy a ship from you.

428
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,571
I see.

429
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,409
- Usopp mentioned that you're sailors.
- Nope, not sailors.

430
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,492
We're pirates.

431
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,621
This ought to be good.

432
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,875
- Pirates?
- Yep.

433
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,002
We haven't sailed together for long,

434
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,921
but we have already
defeated an evil clown,

435
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,590
raided a Marine base,

436
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,051
and taken down
a captain with an axe for a hand.

437
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,471
These sound a lot
like your adventures, Usopp.

438
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,640
Yeah, that's... That's crazy.

439
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
Oh yeah. And we're just getting started.

440
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,314
What are you doing?
Get down from there at once!

441
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,650
Being a pirate has been my dream
for as long as I can remember.

442
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,862
And I'm finally making it a reality.

443
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,994
We're heading out to the Grand Line,
where even more adventures await us.

444
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,873
And at the end of the journey,
I'm gonna find the ultimate treasure,

445
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,626
the One Piece, and become

446
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,045
King of the Pirates.

447
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,297
You're serious?

448
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,136
Kaya,

449
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,306
you have a beautiful ship out there.

450
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,517
A caravel with a sheep figurehead.

451
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,851
It spoke to me.

452
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,354
That's the ship we need
to follow our dreams.

453
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,357
I promise you,
we'll take care of it. Maintain it.

454
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,568
Treat it like
any other member of our crew,

455
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,404
because a ship is also a home.

456
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,824
That will be quite enough!

457
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,203
I should've known Usopp
would bring riffraff to our doorstep.

458
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,914
Klahadore, it's okay. I...

459
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,378
Now look what you've done.
You've upset Miss Kaya.

460
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,172
- All of you, out of this house at once!
- No.

461
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,635
It's late. Let them stay the night.

462
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,972
As you wish, Miss Kaya,

463
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,599
but they are out
first thing in the morning.

464
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,315
That went pretty well.

465
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,066
Don't you think?

466
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,993
Vice-Admiral, I...

467
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,206
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

468
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,626
No. You've just saved me
from getting beaten again.

469
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,003
What is it?

470
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,965
We spotted the wreckage
of an abandoned sloop.

471
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,552
Found this on board.

472
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,765
They couldn't have gotten far.
What's the nearest island to our location?

473
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,933
It's Gecko Island, sir.

474
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,231
Gather a landing party
and make for shore.

475
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,109
I want those pirates found.

476
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,569
- Yes, sir.
- Not you.

477
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,029
Him.

478
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,112
What?!

479
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,910
Your position as senior cadet
has proven unwarranted.

480
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,621
Nepotism can only get you so far.

481
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,250
This is your chance
to show me what you've got, cadet.

482
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,753
Don't waste it.

483
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,421
Yes, sir.

484
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,655
Heavens!

485
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,699
Are you trying to give me a fright?

486
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
So sorry.

487
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,077
I tend to be

488
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,538
light on my feet.

489
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,166
I must speak with Miss Kaya immediately.

490
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,337
This whole notion of transferring
the shipbuilding business to you

491
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,131
is highly unusual, to say the least.

492
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,217
I have run this estate
for Miss Kaya for years,

493
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,843
so it is only natural

494
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,889
that she should ask me to run
the family business until she's ready.

495
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,308
I would like to discuss the matter
with Miss Kaya.

496
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,520
These are our wishes, Merry.

497
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,313
Then she can tell me herself.

498
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,899
That young woman has been through enough,

499
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,777
and I won't let anyone
take advantage of her.

500
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,531
How did you...

501
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Klahadore?

502
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,096
I won't stand for this any longer.

503
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,003
Is this the best way
to ask for an autograph?

504
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,506
I mean, sheesh! Fans have gotten so toxic.

505
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,094
All right, what do you want?

506
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,346
Tickets to the show?

507
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,308
I can get you house seats. They're pricey.

508
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,648
Oh, I'm no fan of yours.

509
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,158
Arlong?

510
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,038
I run things here
in the East Blue.

511
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,251
I'm here to remind you
of your place in the food chain.

512
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:54,467
You pull a job in my seas,
you gotta pay tribute.

513
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:59,055
But, Arlong, baby,
you don't gotta worry about me.

514
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,183
I'm small potatoes.
Pirating's more of a side gig.

515
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,608
Kuroobi tells me
you ransacked Orange Town.

516
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,318
Ransacked?

517
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,505
You should've seen the place
before I got there, okay?

518
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,738
It was a real fixer-upper.

519
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,950
You bore me, clown.

520
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,369
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Wait.

521
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,541
You know who's out there
really disrespecting you?

522
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,753
It's that little rubber prick
in a straw hat. Goes by the name of Luffy.

523
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,382
Never heard of him.

524
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,677
He just knocked over
a Marine base in Shells Town.

525
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,804
And then he stole a map of the Grand Line,

526
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,640
and now he's talking shit
about finding the One Piece.

527
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,813
The One Piece.

528
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:55,695
An excuse for humans
to spread their filth across the seas.

529
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,533
Listen, why don't you let me live,

530
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:05,121
and then I help you find Luffy?

531
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,333
Ah. Ah. Ah.

532
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,424
And how do you plan to do that?

533
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,137
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

534
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,115
Hey, Zoro!

535
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,659
Sh! Shut up.

536
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
You always carry those swords with you?

537
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,297
Wherever I go, the Wado Ichimonji goes.

538
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,551
- Where are you going anyways?
- I'm looking for a drink.

539
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,678
This place is a maze.

540
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,724
How about you?

541
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,103
Midnight snack.

542
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,189
Of course.

543
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,570
Come on.
We'll follow my nose to the kitchen.

544
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,581
Nami?

545
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,085
What are you doing?
Is everything all right?

546
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,172
Sorry, this house is so massive.
I was just trying to find the bathroom.

547
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
With a pillowcase?

548
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,185
So... you are a pirate after all.

549
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,689
I hate pirates.

550
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,358
But I am who I am.

551
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,027
And

552
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,113
I won't apologize for that.

553
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,867
To be honest, I find some of the decor
to be a bit gaudy.

554
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,577
I'd prefer to donate it to charity.

555
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,162
I'm not charity.

556
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,122
No, of course not.

557
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,959
I simply meant
what's the point in having so much

558
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,128
if you can't share it with others?

559
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,088
Like those in need. Family.

560
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,424
Friends.

561
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,759
So we're friends now?

562
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,470
You don't even know me.

563
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,015
Usopp does, and that's a start.

564
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,028
So what do we do now?

565
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,031
Have a sleepover? Do each other's makeup?

566
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,578
Kaya, are you okay?

567
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,416
Not you too.

568
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,543
What?

569
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,214
Everyone's so careful around me.

570
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,383
Like one wrong move and I'll break.

571
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,135
I don't want your pity.

572
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,137
Well, you won't get it then.

573
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,149
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

574
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,610
Not after that dinner.

575
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,075
I hope I didn't get you
in trouble with Kaya.

576
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,285
Sometimes I get carried away.

577
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,830
Oh, no. It was worth it.

578
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,165
Seeing that look on Klahadore's face.

579
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,379
I thought his head was gonna explode.

580
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,636
All that stuff true that you said?
About the clown and the axe-hand guy?

581
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,680
Mm-hmm.

582
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,763
Every word.

583
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,852
I mean, they're not as exciting
as your adventures.

584
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,355
Yeah.

585
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,526
And the One Piece,
are you really going after that?

586
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,277
Yep.

587
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,655
I'm gonna be the one to find it too.

588
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,657
Man!

589
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,453
I wish I could do that.

590
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,912
But

591
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,706
I can't leave.

592
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,668
Kaya needs me.

593
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,297
- Is she your girlfriend or something?
- What?

594
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,591
Oh.

595
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,967
Um...

596
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,178
Usopp and me? No. No.

597
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,390
{\an8}We've known each other for years.
Ever since his mother died.

598
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,562
{\an8}He didn't have anybody, so my parents
gave him a job at the shipyard.

599
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,481
He likes to come around

600
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:28,903
and tell me all about his brave exploits
and grand adventures.

601
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,156
And truth is,

602
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,699
they make me feel better.

603
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,537
She's more like... my best friend.

604
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,502
Her parents died a few years ago,
and she... took it pretty hard, and...

605
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,755
and then she got sick on top of that.

606
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,594
I just want to be there for her, you know?

607
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,139
<i>Your parents,</i>

608
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,557
what happened to them?

609
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,270
They, um...

610
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,691
They died at sea.

611
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,033
All these years
and it still takes my breath away.

612
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,871
I couldn't even
go through their belongings.

613
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,961
Just... locked up the memories
in the East Wing, where their bedroom was.

614
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,598
Have you ever lost anyone close to you?

616
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,934
No.

617
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,396
I'm jealous.

618
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,983
Said the rich girl.

619
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,154
You're not very good
at this friends thing, are you?

620
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,162
No, I guess I'm not.

621
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,207
<i>She's gorgeous,</i>

622
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,376
and she's super smart.

623
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,670
She has the best laugh.

624
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,839
But, I mean,

625
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:17,595
you don't think
she, like, <i>like</i> likes me, do you?

626
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,765
You're asking the wrong guy.

627
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,059
Okay. But if you were Kaya,
would you like me?

628
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,143
I already like you.

629
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,813
Okay, that's not what I... I...

630
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,773
Never mind.

631
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,862
Wow.

632
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,073
You're a great shot!

633
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,994
Got it from my dad.
He's a notorious pirate.

634
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,746
I don't really remember him that well,

635
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,790
'cause he left for a life at sea
when I was just a baby,

636
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,709
but he'll be back one day.

637
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,421
Yasopp the Great!

638
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,465
Yasopp?

639
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,260
He's your dad?

640
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,554
- Yeah. Why? You heard of him?
- Heard of him?

641
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,307
I know him! I...

642
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,100
He's a part of Shanks' crew!

643
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,895
Wait. You know my dad?

644
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,314
Yeah, yeah, I do! He's the best.

645
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,441
Always made time for some pirate wisdom.

646
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,734
So you guys, like,

647
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,818
hung out?

648
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,904
Yeah.

649
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,281
That's

650
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,283
cool.

651
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,871
If you're gonna talk about feelings,
I'm really gonna need a drink.

652
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,457
Uh, there's a wine cellar in the basement.

653
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,793
Why didn't you tell me that before?

654
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,717
You coming?

655
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,139
Nope.

656
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,854
Got everything I need right here.

657
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,169
Now we're talking.

658
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,016
I'm pretty sure
they keep the good stuff over here.

659
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,184
Oh!

660
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,858
Zoro. Zoro?

661
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,110
It's Mer... It's Merry. He's...

662
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,778
He's dea...

663
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,787
Five blades.

664
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,331
I think I've seen this before.

665
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,918
Well, well, well.

666
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,299
It appears
we have some rats in our cellar.

667
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,058
Those blades.

668
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,062
I knew I'd seen your face somewhere.

669
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,191
On a wanted poster.

670
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,695
You're Kuro,
captain of the Black Cat Pirates.

671
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,791
- Wait, Klahadore's a pirate?
- A dead one.

672
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,001
They say you were killed
by Axe-Hand Morgan.

673
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,461
A clever ruse.

674
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,507
One that imbecile's ego
helped me perpetuate.

675
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,133
And as you'll soon learn,

676
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,137
no one interferes in my plans.

677
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,142
So I will collect a bounty tonight.

678
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,109
Uh...

679
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,967
Ah!

680
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,868
Dispose of the bodies.
Outside of the house this time.

681
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,328
No trace left behind.

682
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,414
What about Usopp? He got away.

683
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,207
No matter.

684
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,709
But he could ruin the plan.

685
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,880
Let him say whatever he wants.
No one will believe him anyway.

686
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,185
"Oh, Usopp got away." Ooh.

687
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,396
Go on.

688
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,322
Why don't you join me
for breakfast tomorrow?

689
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,115
Your friends too.

690
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,243
We can discuss a deal for the caravel.

691
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,786
I'd like that.

692
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,252
This may not be my place,

693
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:47,049
but don't let Klahadore,
or anyone for that matter, run your life.

694
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,343
You're stronger than you think.

695
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,971
I appreciate that.

696
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:56,892
Good night, Nami.

697
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,602
Good night.

698
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,067
Don't forget your pillow.

699
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,110
Hmm.

700
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,137
Why do I have to push the cart?

701
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,932
Ugh, because you're twice my size
and half as smart.

702
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,422
A shame to get rid
of such nice swords though.

703
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,342
No trace left behind.

704
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:19,932
Crack on.

705
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,737
<i>Pirates! Pirates!</i>

706
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,071
Help, pirates!

707
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,573
Pirates, help!

708
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,325
Pirates, help, please! Help!

709
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,953
There really are pirates!
The pirates are here!

710
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,538
Someone, help!

711
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,331
Help me! Please open up!

712
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,335
I swear it's the truth.
There really are pirates!

713
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,169
Enough, Usopp. Go home!

714
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,280
- Let me go, Mr. Mornin.
- It's really not funny.

715
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:20,243
- I've heard enough about the pirates.
- You know I'm right. Let me go!

716
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,122
He's at it again, Banchina.
Going on and on about pirates coming.

717
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:29,252
Get hold of your kid
before he gets himself in serious trouble.

718
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,837
Hey! Let me go.

719
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,549
Usopp,

720
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,929
you can't keep telling people
that pirates are coming.

721
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,055
But they are coming.

722
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,975
And Dad's coming with them.
He'll be home soon, I promise.

723
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,062
That's wonderful news, Usopp.

724
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,398
But you do know
that even if he doesn't come...

725
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,610
He will! I know he will.
Then you'll start feeling better.

726
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,153
You're right.

727
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,740
Of course you're right.

728
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,954
Mom?

729
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,624
Mom?

730
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,085
Mom?

731
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,003
Mom!

732
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,633
The pirates are here.

733
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,553
They really are.

734
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,266
Why won't anybody believe me?

735
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,446
I believe you.
