1
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,374
So this pirate butler,
he killed your friend's lawyer

2
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,098
and he's threatening to kill your friend?

3
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,806
My best friend, Kaya.
He's up to something.

4
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,421
Who pretends to be a butler anyway?

5
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,882
You're not actually buying any of this,
are you?

6
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:35,136
Well, I'm telling the truth.
Klahadore is a pirate. No, sorry. Kuro.

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,765
- His name is Captain Kuro.
- Ha! Now I know you're lying.

8
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,727
- Captain Kuro of the Black Cat Pirates?
- Yes. Long claws, tiny glasses.

9
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:47,649
Impossible. My father,
Axe-Hand Morgan, killed him years ago.

10
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,486
Any Marine worth their salt knows that.

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,741
No closer to finding Straw Hat
than we were hours ago.

12
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,034
Straw Hat? You mean Luffy?

13
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,953
Wait. You know Luffy?

14
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,830
My other, other best friend.
He's in trouble.

15
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,666
- Luffy's at the place?
- Yes! Aren't you listening to me?

16
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,293
Someone has to stop Kuro.
I can't do it by myself.

17
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
It's okay. We're here to help.

18
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,465
Isn't that right?

19
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,216
Well, yes.

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,760
By all means.

21
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,220
Lead the way.

22
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,101
Luffy.

23
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,895
Luffy.

24
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,074
Luffy!

25
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,291
Oh, come on.

26
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,042
Yes.

27
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,630
Do you understand?

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,965
I understand, sir.

29
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,320
I understand, sir.

30
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,156
I just left Miss Kaya in her room.

31
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,495
What is he doing here?

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,760
What's wrong with him?

33
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,846
Little guy couldn't get enough
of my latest recipe.

34
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,726
I was chasing that perfect balance
between bitter and savory.

35
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,024
Just wish I could've asked him
how it tasted.

36
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,693
- It tasted like poison, idiot.
- Not while I'm the cook.

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,963
You're not a cook.
I'm not a maid. We're pirates.

38
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,490
Sell yourself short, Sham,
but leave my cooking out of...

39
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,741
Enough!

40
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,828
I can't hear myself think
over your inbred nonsense!

41
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,041
Now, how much of the soup did he eat?

42
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,625
Uh...

43
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,591
All of it.

44
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,679
How fortuitous.

45
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,102
Go ahead and toss him in the well
with the green-haired oaf.

46
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,145
Aye aye, Captain.

47
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,860
And don't you dare track in mud
all over my floors again.

48
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,779
Says the maid.

49
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,549
Who'd ring the bell at this hour?

50
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,468
Just stay put.

51
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,470
Understood?

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,266
Let's not allow the night
to get the better of us.

53
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,073
Marines?

54
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,037
Whatever could be the matter
at this time of night?

55
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,706
Sorry to bother you at such a late hour,

56
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,750
but we heard reports
of pirates in the area.

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,586
What? What are you talking about?
He is the pirate!

58
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,881
He murdered Merry!
Arrest him. What are you waiting for?

59
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,007
Oh dear.

60
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,011
I'm so sorry
if Usopp here has wasted your time.

61
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,888
You see, he's not well.

62
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,558
The entire village
has tried their utmost to help, but

63
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,479
the poor boy has been this way
ever since he was a child.

64
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,314
One lie bigger than the next.

65
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,194
He was never quite the same
after his mother's passing.

66
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,737
Leave my mother out of this.

67
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,865
His gloves! Check his gloves for blades.

68
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,118
Do you mind if we have a look?
Just to be certain.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,495
Well...

70
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm not sure where he gets these ideas.

71
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,043
A butler's gloves. Such an imagination.

72
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,295
I guess some fruit gets so bruised,

73
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,798
it can't help
but to be rotten at the core.

74
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,052
But, uh, I know what I saw.

75
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,678
All right. That's enough.

76
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,347
I thought we had a job to do.

77
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,519
We're looking for a fugitive.
Goes by the name of Luffy.

78
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,603
Luffy?

79
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,898
Luffy, why, yes, I do know that name.

80
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,608
Belongs to one of the lowly criminals

81
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,491
Usopp has introduced
to the lady of the house.

82
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,153
Horrible bunch. Drank the place dry.

83
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,615
I have one of the staff members
keeping an eye on him now.

84
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,461
Buchi, the Marines are here.

85
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,506
<i>They've come to collect
the drunken Straw Hat Pirate.</i>

86
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,591
<i>Bring him to the front of the house
at once.</i>

87
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,676
Marines.

88
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,887
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

89
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,807
But what if the Straw Hat talks?

90
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,103
He drank enough of that soup
to kill a sea beast.

91
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,563
Stick to the captain's plan.

92
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,031
Come on, sweetheart.

93
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,328
You've got it all wrong.

94
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,457
Luffy is a pirate, sure,
but not like Kuro.

95
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,836
It's... it's confusing, but please.
Kaya. Kaya's in danger!

96
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,965
Sorry, Usopp. You don't have any proof.
There's nothing I can do.

97
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,993
What's wrong with him?

98
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,269
Insatiable appetite, I suppose.

99
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,521
Too much food, too much liquor.

100
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,441
But for a pirate, nothing is ever enough.

101
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,278
Good thing we have Marines like yourselves
to keep the East Blue safe.

102
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,405
Now, if that is all,

103
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,074
I really must return to my duties.

104
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,495
Wait. I just have a few more questions.

105
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,829
Of course.

106
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,574
- What was that?
- Old houses.

107
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,995
You know, they're just like us.
The older they get, the more they creak.

108
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,079
You sure?

109
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:00,957
It sounded like...

110
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,877
I shall stick to my expertise
and leave you to yours.

111
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,464
You do have your fugitive in hand
after all.

112
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,968
- He's lying. Everything he says...
- That's enough out of you.

113
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,434
Help! Please!
Pirates! Somebody, help!

114
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,563
Please, pirates! Someone, help, please!

115
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,189
Can't reason with madness.

116
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:30,194
Now, I really must return to my duties.

117
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,532
On behalf of the Marines, we thank...

118
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,310
<i>Again!</i>

119
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,156
Ah.

120
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,462
Fight!

121
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,345
Again!

122
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,664
Next!

123
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,261
You're dropping your elbow.

124
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,057
Just some friendly advice.

125
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,811
We're not friends, Kuina.
And I don't need advice from you.

126
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,523
Your movements say otherwise.

127
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,360
Have you learned anything
during your time here?

128
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,155
Don't mock me!
I'm the best fighter here other than you.

129
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,200
And one day, I'm gonna surpass you.

130
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,703
Then I'm gonna be
the world's greatest swordsman.

131
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,037
Maybe one day.

132
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,039
But not today.

133
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,380
I know why I can't beat you.
It's these bamboo swords.

134
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,007
Let's fight with real blades
to see who's best.

135
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,927
Fine.

136
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,097
Katanas it is.

137
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,933
But if you want to beat me,

138
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,853
you'd better be ready to kill me.

139
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,749
Okay. Plan B.

140
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,916
Kaya!

141
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,962
Kaya, hurry up! Let me in!

142
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,589
Open the window!

143
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,883
- Usopp?
- Yeah, hurry up.

144
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,966
Hurry up. Come on.

145
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,723
Kaya.

146
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,685
There's pirates in the house.

147
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,647
I know. You invited them.

148
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,317
No, not those pirates. The other pirates.

149
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,943
You're in danger.

150
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,405
- Usopp, you're not making any sense.
- Please, Kaya, we gotta get out of here.

151
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,699
I'm not going anywhere.
It's the middle of the night.

152
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,911
How about I ring for Klahadore?
We can have...

153
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,705
No, don't call Klahadore!

154
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,612
He's the one trying to hurt you.

155
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,462
He killed Merry.

156
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,464
Merry?

157
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,300
He was here only a few hours ago.

158
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,052
Yeah. Now he's dead.

159
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,679
Klahadore isn't a butler.

160
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,763
He's...

161
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,766
he's a vicious pirate.

162
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,019
Usopp, you're scaring me.

163
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:38,609
Klahadore gave up his life to care for me.
Why would he want to hurt me? Hurt Merry?

164
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,027
I... I don't know.

165
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,530
Maybe he wants your money.

166
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,658
Usopp.

167
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,954
Kaya,

168
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,958
please, just believe me.

169
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,209
You always believe me.

170
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:59,088
I believed your stories
because they were fun. This one isn't.

171
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,382
This isn't a story.
It's the truth. You gotta listen!

172
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,641
I don't think you know
what the truth is anymore.

173
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,810
I think you should go, Usopp.

174
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,022
- Kaya...
- Please.

175
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,899
Just go.

176
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,165
No.

177
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,043
I'm done running.

178
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,010
I'm not leaving your side.

179
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,471
Not until I know you're safe.

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,530
Sham!

181
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,536
What the hell happened?

182
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,956
The orange-haired girl.

183
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,125
She was hiding.

184
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,877
She overheard everything.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,962
And you let her get away?

186
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,048
She came out of nowhere.

187
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,307
The time for waiting is over.

188
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,685
Kaya is of age.

189
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,730
And we can finally put this farce to bed.

190
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,358
So we kill her now?

191
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,277
Yes, Buchi.

192
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,238
No more hiding who we are.

193
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,743
And to be absolutely certain
we're not interrupted,

194
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,829
lock the house down.

195
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,122
Yes, Captain.

196
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,234
What's that?

197
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,529
The security shutters.

198
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,864
My parents built them
to keep the pirates out.

199
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,826
But now they're keeping the pirates in...
with us.

200
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,042
Thank God you're still alive.

201
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,378
Why wouldn't we be alive?

202
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,852
Ah!

203
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,900
Poison?

204
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,278
What are you talking about?

205
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,801
I overheard them in the kitchen.
It's been going on for years.

206
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,493
- Did Usopp put you up to this?
- I didn't even know.

207
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,874
I gave you that tea.

208
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,086
Think about it, Kaya.
When did you start getting sick?

209
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,255
Was it around the time
Kuro started working here?

210
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,383
Listen to me.

211
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,972
If we stay here, we die.
We have to leave now.

212
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,190
Kaya.

213
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,028
Oh, Miss Kaya.

214
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,239
Kaya!

215
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,412
We're all alone now.

216
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,164
Why,

217
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,584
parents are gone.

218
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,295
Your friends are all gone.

219
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,423
Even Usopp is gone.

220
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,386
It's just you and me, Miss Kaya.

221
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,305
It's time

222
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,850
to wake up!

223
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,907
Where are we going?

224
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,011
We gotta get out of the house.

225
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,911
Another crank
can open the shutters.

226
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,205
It's in my parents' bedroom
in the east wing.

227
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,382
Are you sure?
Maybe there's another way.

228
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,009
This is the only option. We have to go...

229
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,725
There you are, Miss Kaya.

230
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,691
It's your birthday.
It's time to celebrate!

231
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,734
Run!

232
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,838
Ready to learn your lesson?

233
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,425
Not in this lifetime. Let's end this.

234
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,476
Two swords not enough?

235
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,312
Maybe you should've brought more.

236
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,575
You're dropping your elbow again.

237
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,386
Shut up and fight!

238
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,909
I can't beat you.

239
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,577
Just kill me.

240
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,143
I don't deserve to wield a sword.

241
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,272
Don't be an idiot.

242
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,192
You've always had raw skill.

243
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,278
And you'll only get better.

244
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,910
You'll surpass me
in size, strength, and speed.

245
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,370
Eventually,

246
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,207
you'll surpass me in everything.

247
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,542
That's dumb.

248
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,128
No, that's nature.

249
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,629
I'm small now.

250
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:49,302
And fast. But soon,
all the boys will get taller and stronger.

251
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,221
Their arms will be longer than mine.

252
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,890
Who cares about that kind of stuff?

253
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,892
Don't you get it?

254
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,020
Girls can beat boys,

255
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,816
but no woman can beat a man.

256
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,279
Don't say that.

257
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,950
Don't make excuses.

258
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,201
You're my goal.

259
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,915
If you just give up,
what has all our training been for?

260
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,876
Let's fight every day.

261
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,546
We'll keep getting better and stronger
until one of us becomes the greatest.

262
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,549
You'd do that for me?

263
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,139
I, Roronoa Zoro,

264
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,893
vow to fight, train,
and kick your butt every single day.

265
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,191
Then I, Shimotsuki Kuina,

266
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:50,363
vow to fight, train,
and kick your butt every single day.

267
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,119
If we keep that vow, one of us will become
the world's greatest swordsman...

268
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,203
Or woman.

269
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,246
...to ever live.

270
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,927
I don't know.
Something feels really off about this.

271
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,906
You know, you're the only person I know
who'd actually feel bad

272
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,849
about capturing the fugitive
you're supposed to capture.

273
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,730
I know that Usopp guy might be full of it,
but that butler gives me the creeps.

274
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,191
Sure, take the side of the pirates.

275
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,194
I'm sure Garp would love that too.

276
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,821
It's not my fault I'm doing a good job,

277
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,032
and the Vice-Admiral sees it.

278
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,412
The only reason you're here is
'cause you're friends with that Straw Hat.

279
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,374
Garp doesn't believe in you.

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,501
He's using you.

281
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,418
No, he's not.

282
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,505
You're just jealous.

283
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,173
Doesn't make me wrong.

284
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,635
Meat.

285
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,099
What was that, Straw Hat?

286
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,270
You got something to say?

287
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,414
Oh.

288
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,791
Okay.

289
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,044
Big, creepy room. No problem.

290
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,268
It was a spider.

291
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,607
We treated him like family.

292
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,610
How did I not see it?
How did I not see him?

293
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,111
It's not your fault.

294
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,739
He took advantage of you.

295
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,576
Now, I need you to be strong
so we can get out of here.

296
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,263
What would they think of me?

297
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,767
- They'd be so disappointed.
- No.

298
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,686
No, they'd want you to survive,

299
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,938
and that is exactly
what we are going to do.

300
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,287
Pull.

301
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,536
Sensei.

302
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,415
I was just waiting for Kuina.

303
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,333
Do you know where she is?

304
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,378
Kuina is...

305
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,971
There was an accident.

306
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,349
She's...

307
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,398
She's gone.

308
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,335
But...

309
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,463
she can't be.

310
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,383
We made a promise.

311
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,028
We made a promise.

312
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,318
Sensei, please give me the honor
of allowing me to carry Kuina's sword.

313
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,823
The Wado Ichimonji is a rare blade.

314
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,786
Why should I allow you to carry it?

315
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,504
<i>Because Kuina and I made a promise</i>

316
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,968
that one of us would become the world's
greatest swordsman to ever live.

317
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,308
Then it's up to you
to fulfill that promise.

318
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,351
<i>For you</i>

319
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
<i>and for her.</i>

320
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,674
Koby.

321
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,720
I gotta go back.

322
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,637
The butler.

323
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,185
He's gonna kill Kaya,
and then he's gonna go after my crew.

324
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,355
I'm under direct orders to bring you in.

325
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,568
You said you wanted
to help innocent people.

326
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,945
Kaya's innocent.

327
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,531
You know what? Screw this.

328
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,576
Helmeppo, don't!

329
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,412
Father always said, "Dead pirate
weighs the same as a live one."

330
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,290
- Garp gave us strict orders.
- He gave <i>you</i> strict orders.

331
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,209
Start walking, pirate,

332
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,292
or die.

333
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,386
Hey, haircut.

334
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,639
Zoro!

335
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,023
- How'd you know where to find me?
- I didn't.

336
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,566
Thought I was headed to the house.

337
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,988
Hold it right there!

338
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,158
By order of the Marines,
I'm placing you under arrest.

339
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,623
Koby...

340
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,878
I know you've got a job to do...

341
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,716
but I'm gonna go back and help my friends.

342
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,638
So don't try to stop me.

343
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,452
God, this thing needs some oil.

344
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,539
No, it just needs a little elbow grease.

345
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,957
Kaya.

346
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,460
Oh, Miss Kaya.

347
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,719
Sounds like we have
a bigger rat problem than I thought.

348
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,102
Maybe we need a cat in the house.

349
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,526
Now, now, Kaya,

350
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,904
I know you're in here.

351
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,415
Come out. There's no point
in hiding who we are anymore.

352
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,505
Isn't it exhausting putting on airs,

353
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,175
pretending we're better than we are?!

354
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:04,096
You've had every opportunity
this world has to offer.

355
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,140
What have you done with your life?

356
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,019
Nothing. Absolutely nothing!

357
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,146
You are a pathetic,

358
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:16,359
spoiled, sniveling little brat!

359
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,952
Oh, come now, Kaya.

360
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,208
Let's not make this
more difficult than it need be, hmm?

361
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,424
Just consider this payback

362
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:46,847
for all those years
spent listening to your incessant whining.

363
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,936
"Klahadore,

364
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,273
the soup's too hot."

365
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,858
"Bring my blanky, Klahadore."

366
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,529
"Make my tea. Brush my hair."

367
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,282
"Oh, Klahadore..."

368
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,252
"I miss my mommy and my daddy."

369
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:22,675
When all I wanted to do
was rip your tongue out!

370
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,174
Let's split up.

371
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,022
Where to look next?

372
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:06,654
Well, you always were Daddy's little girl,

373
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,616
even if he didn't have
enough time for you, hmm?

374
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,121
Don't.

375
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,835
I'm stronger than you think.

376
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,861
Too easy.

377
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,442
I thought we took out the trash.

378
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,258
Maybe this time, we keep his swords.

379
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,360
Ya!

380
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,034
Goodbye, Miss Kaya.

381
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,541
Ah.

382
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,253
These are my friends.

383
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,673
You don't get to mess with them.

384
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,012
You are annoyingly resilient.

385
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,721
Well,

386
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,891
I am made of rubber.

387
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,689
Ah!

388
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,655
Did you really think
you could get the best of me?

389
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,325
I'm Kuro of the Thousand Plans.

390
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,537
Usopp.

391
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,623
Usopp. Usopp.

392
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,960
Then come out and fight me.

393
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,962
No, you poor, poor sap.

394
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,008
So you think you want to be a pirate?

395
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,010
I am a pirate.

396
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,351
And how long have you been on the seas?
A week? A month?

397
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,480
I was a captain for years,

398
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,524
and I never failed in a raid.

399
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,151
Not once.

400
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,486
And what did I get in return?

401
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,196
A life of worry

402
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,575
and a target on my back
as wide as the East Blue.

403
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,873
Is that what you want?

404
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,252
A lifetime of always
looking over your shoulder.

405
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,676
You'll never get
a peaceful night's rest

406
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,513
because someone's always waiting
to slit your throat.

407
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,682
Pirates, Marines.

408
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,518
Why, even your own crew.

409
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,605
Not my crew.

410
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,609
We've got each other's backs.

411
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,735
Always.

412
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,279
Ay!

413
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,031
Until the day they don't.

414
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,743
I've killed more crewmates
than I care to remember.

415
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,954
They're expendable.
Every single one of them.

416
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,378
Sham!

417
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:10,207
Being a pirate is not about
raiding villages or perfect plans.

418
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,085
It's about adventure.

419
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,045
And freedom.

420
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,177
Freedom?

421
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,098
There's no such thing
with a bounty on your head.

422
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,562
You gave up on your dream.

423
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,192
No one who does that
can ever call themselves a pirate.

424
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,960
Looks like you're the one giving up now.

425
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,879
No.

426
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,632
I'm done talking.

427
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,844
Now I'm listening.

428
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,195
Ah!

429
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,412
You didn't plan for that, did ya?

430
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,222
Sham!

431
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,245
Gum Gum...

432
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,375
Bell!

433
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,762
Whoo!

434
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,038
I'm sorry about the mess.

435
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,707
You probably need some new staff.

436
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,002
I think I'm done with staff for a bit.

437
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,007
- Too bad we can't collect their bounty.
- No. No.

438
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,802
The Marines already know where we are.
We have to get out of here.

439
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,428
Where are we gonna go?

440
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,514
We don't even have a ship.

441
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:38,975
Yes,

442
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,894
you do.

443
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,378
Wow.

444
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,468
That looks just like your lawyer friend.

445
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,764
Merry ran the shipyard
after my parents passed.

446
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,979
He was their dearest colleague.
My oldest companion.

447
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,606
Then his memory will live on.

448
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,068
I hereby name this ship

449
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,280
the Going Merry!

450
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,865
It's yours now.

451
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,910
- Your new home.
- Thank you, Kaya.

452
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,291
Whoo!

453
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,084
Yeah! We did it!

454
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,378
Yeah!

455
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,635
Usopp!

456
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,725
What are you waiting for? Get your stuff.

457
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,350
What stuff?

458
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,438
You're coming with us. Right?

459
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,521
What?

460
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,733
Uh... uh...

461
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,818
No. I... I couldn't.

462
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,236
Just come on already.

463
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,032
I'm gonna need a great sharp shooter.

464
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,826
Just like Yasopp.

465
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,622
And I saw what you did back there.
Sticking up for your friends.

466
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,751
That's exactly the kind of guy
I need on my crew.

467
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,087
But...

468
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,423
I couldn't leave Syrup Village.

469
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,973
What... what about Kaya?

470
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,017
She needs me to take care of her.

471
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,436
Usopp,

472
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,857
you've been a great friend,

473
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,445
but I think it's time
I start taking care of myself.

474
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,491
But I said I'd never leave you.

475
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:04,287
And don't you need help with the shipyard?

476
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,542
The shipyard was my parents' dream.

477
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,504
I think I might do something different.

478
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,842
Like study to become a doctor.

479
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,557
So... I guess

480
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,268
this is goodbye.

481
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,775
I'll see you again someday.

482
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,153
And when I do,

483
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,824
I expect to hear all about
the real adventures of Captain Usopp.

484
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,333
They... they do know I'm the captain, right?

485
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,919
Let them have this one.

486
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:58,984
Hello.

487
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,623
Mmm.

488
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,714
Yahoo!

489
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,259
Yeah!

490
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,677
Oh.

491
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,851
I told you it would work out.

492
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,437
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

493
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,814
Get used to what?

494
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,732
Being right.

495
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,092
I failed my first mission.

496
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,846
I failed to capture the target.

497
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,140
I didn't get Luffy.

498
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,437
It was just like you said.
I overthought it.

499
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,399
Don't be too hard on yourself.

500
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,194
You did exactly
what you were supposed to do.

501
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,823
Sir, I don't understand.

502
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,617
The real lesson here...

503
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,288
always have a back-up plan.

504
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,253
You flushed them out, son.

505
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,215
Sail ho!
Two points aft the starboard beam!

506
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,550
Mission accomplished.

507
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,475
Guys! Check it out.

508
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,770
Using my unparalleled artistic talent,

509
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:01,232
I made us a new Jolly Roger for the ship.

510
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,279
Ta-da!

511
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,871
I know. I know. My flair for design
often leaves people speechless.

512
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,584
- I already drew our flag.
- Okay, but this one is so much better.

513
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,420
Neither of the flags
are gonna scare anyone away.

514
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,173
Okay, but the Jolly Roger
is supposed to reflect the captain.

515
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,466
I <i>am</i> the captain.

516
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,677
- We are the Straw Hat crew.
- They call me Captain Usopp.

517
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,263
I am the captain.
Me, captain. Captain, me.

518
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,724
The captain is the one
that gets the ship

519
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,184
and knows the most about the ship.

520
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,267
I am...

521
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,649
Okay.

522
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,234
You see?

523
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,362
This is what it's all about.

524
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:53,201
From now on,
it's all gonna be smooth sailing.

525
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,375
What was that?

526
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,672
You had to open your mouth.

527
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,680
Marines! We're under attack!

528
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,482
Let's put one off their stern rail.

529
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,448
Grandpa?

530
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,992
Grandpa?
