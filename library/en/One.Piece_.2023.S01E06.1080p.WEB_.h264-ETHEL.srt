1
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,297
Easy. Easy!

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,801
Easy.

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,053
{\an8}Easy. Don't drop him.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,222
{\an8}I didn't. He's really heavy.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,517
{\an8}I mean, he's got a really big head.
It's, like, freakishly big.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,602
{\an8}What does that
have to do with anything?

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,480
{\an8}- Zoro? Hey, can you hear me?
- Where's the first aid kit?

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,774
- Do we have a first aid kit?
- Zoro?

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,011
These are all I could find.
Where's he bleeding from?

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,948
Everywhere.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,218
- We need more towels.
- We need a doctor.

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,922
Last I checked, we don't have one.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,704
Luffy? Luffy!

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,249
Someone needs to go back to Baratie.

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,252
Um, I'm really not hungry right now, Nami.

16
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,712
Not for food.

17
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,214
Maybe one of the customers
is a ship's doctor.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,717
Right. A doctor.

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,969
We need a doctor.

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,557
- What do you think you're doing?
- Chopping carrots, chef.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,036
Yeah, I can see that.
But why are you doing it in my kitchen?

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
I demoted you, remember?

23
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,772
That you did. But Patty's
sleeping off a brutal hangover,

24
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,441
so unless you want to do brunch prep
all by yourself...

25
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,526
Fine.

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,697
Them carrots are cut too thick.

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,075
And those eggs are way too runny.

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,288
And I can tell just by looking at that,
that rémoulade needs a lot more oregano.

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,124
Oregano is for savages.

30
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,918
Help! Help!

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,296
Help! Help! Zoro... Zoro needs a doctor.

32
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,049
He got into a fight with this warlord guy,
but he lost.

33
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,195
- And now he's bleeding from everywhere...
- Whoa. Whoa. Slow down, Chore Boy.

34
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,555
- I can't understand a word you're saying.
- My friend is dying.

35
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,475
Nearest doctor's on the Conomi Islands.
It's a two-day sail from here.

36
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,558
That's too long.

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,561
I can't help you.
Hope your friend makes it.

38
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,063
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,982
- To help Chore Boy's friend.
- Brunch is not gonna prep itself.

40
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,906
You always told me
to feed anyone who's hungry.

41
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,820
I don't see how this is any different.

42
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,988
Fine.

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,785
Bring me my kitchen knives
and a bottle of our best whiskey.

44
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,830
And a fresh yellowtail from the cooler.
Bigger the better.

45
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,913
A yellowtail?

46
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,541
Just do it already.

47
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,054
Are you kidding? He needs a doctor.

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,390
Do you wanna save
your swordsman friend or not?

49
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,232
- Is that to sterilize the wounds?
- Hell, no.

50
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,234
That'd be a waste of really good liquor.

51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,696
Beautiful.

52
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,206
Needle.

53
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,426
Fish skin.

54
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,806
This is an old seaman's trick.

55
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:07,103
The fish skin helps staunch the wounds
and heals the flesh a lot faster.

56
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,022
Is he gonna be okay?

57
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,345
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
He's lost a lot of blood.

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,320
- It might be too late for him.
- But it might not be.

59
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,157
He's got one foot in each world right now,
caught between life and death.

60
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,578
You have to find a way
to keep him tethered to our world.

61
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:28,333
Talk to him. Tell him stories.
Sing him sea shanties for all I care.

62
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,835
He may not reply,

63
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,380
but at least he'll know
his crew are still with him.

64
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,389
Mihawk.

65
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,517
Nice of you to announce yourself.

66
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,521
I thought this was a conversation
we might have privately.

67
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,607
Dismissed, cadet.

68
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,734
Aye, sir.

69
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,160
So where is he?

70
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,744
Where's Luffy?

71
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,123
- At the moment, I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,000
I decided to let him go.

73
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,588
I specifically told you
to bring him to me.

74
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,133
Come now, Vice-Admiral.
I don't take orders.

75
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,094
Not even from the likes of you.

76
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,012
As one of the Seven Warlords,

77
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,473
you serve at the pleasure
of the World Government.

78
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,310
- Without our immunity...
- I would still do precisely what I want.

79
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,937
No more and no less.

80
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,438
And what I want

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,609
is to see what becomes of that young man
when he enters the Grand Line.

82
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,693
Ha!

83
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,321
I won't let that happen.

84
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,824
Then you have
your work cut out for you, Vice-Admiral,

85
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,119
because that boy is interesting.

86
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,290
Who knows?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,628
Maybe your grandson will be the one
to find the One Piece after all.

88
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,290
I'll take my dinner
in the mess hall tonight.

89
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,428
Mmm. Something smells delicious.

90
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,265
I just thought everyone'd be hungry, man.
Plenty we didn't use.

91
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,709
- Never waste food.
- Cool.

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,605
What's the matter? Don't like fish?

93
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,650
I love fish. I just need
to get Zoro's sword ready for him.

94
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,028
You know, for when he wakes up.

95
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,700
He's, uh,

96
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,078
pretty badly hurt, man.

97
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,956
There's an itty-bitty chance
he might not wake up.

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,125
Zoro's the strongest fighter that I know.

99
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,171
No way he's gonna let
some warlord guy beat him.

100
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,631
Well, you've gotta eat.

101
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,927
Come on. If you don't want the fish,
I got two-inch T-bones in the kitchen.

102
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,805
Or, uh, maybe you're in the mood
for saffron risotto?

103
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,682
I normally would get both,

104
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,436
but I really gotta get
the Waddy Itchy Monkey ready for him.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,938
- The what?
- His sword.

106
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,357
It's got a name.

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Oh.

108
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,402
- Why?
- I don't know.

109
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,195
He said it was kind of special.

110
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,158
Hey, Sanji, can you cook
Zoro's favorite food?

111
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,577
Sure. What does he like?

112
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,123
- He really likes rice balls.
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,040
And beer.

114
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,000
What about rice balls soaked in beer?

115
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,669
Can you make that?

116
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,547
I can make anything.
Just tell me what you want.

117
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,465
I want him to eat

118
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,968
so that he gets back his strength.

119
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,972
But I also want him to sleep
so that his wounds can heal.

120
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,017
Or maybe...
maybe he just needs some water. Right?

121
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,063
After all of that fighting,
he must be awfully thirsty.

122
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,899
But, you know,
he's probably also tired, so...

123
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,862
so yeah, we should just let him rest.

124
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,534
Being a captain,
it's the toughest job in the world, okay?

125
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,035
Zeff once told me

126
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,540
that making decisions is what separates
a captain from the rest of his crew.

127
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,711
And he was one of the best pirate captains
that ever sailed the seas.

128
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,920
Zeff was a pirate?

129
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,216
Yeah. Captain of the dreaded Cook Pirates.
They used to call him "Red Leg Zeff,"

130
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,303
'cause his boots were always stained
with the blood of his enemies.

131
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,139
How'd you two meet?
Were you on his crew or something?

132
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,223
Not exactly.

133
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,986
Sanji, get a move on.
Those tables ain't gonna bus themselves.

134
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,406
I'm working on my velouté.
Gotta get the texture just right.

135
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,533
Velou... what? This is a ship's galley.

136
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,660
You're never gonna serve
fancy stuff like that.

137
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,871
I will when I get to the All Blue.

138
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,208
Hear that, boys?
Sanji's going to the All Blue!

139
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,420
It's not a real place, kid.
The All Blue doesn't exist.

140
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,881
Yes, it does.
And one day, I'm gonna find it.

141
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,968
It's a tall tale told by cooks
to pass the time. Now get to those tables.

142
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,305
Pirates! We're getting boarded!

143
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,475
Pirates? We've gotta get out of here!

144
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,293
Mmm, velouté.

145
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,425
No, no, no, no.

146
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,344
Needs oregano.

147
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,181
Oregano's for savages!

148
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,188
Nice try, little eggplant.
Now, how do you wanna die? Quick or slow?

149
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,816
Who cares? I'd rather die
than have you season my food.

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,650
You made that?

151
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,527
That's not half bad.

152
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,947
Better than anything you can make,
you old shitbag!

153
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,241
You've got a sharp tongue on you, boy.

154
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,703
How about I cut it out
and fry it up with some pig fat?

155
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,456
Do what you want,
but I'm not gonna die here.

156
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,208
Not until I find the All Blue.

157
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,084
The All Blue?

158
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,382
So you tell me, what does little eggplant
know about the All Blue?

159
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,731
Huh?

160
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,152
What happened?

161
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,861
A storm.

162
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,698
Sunk both our ships.

163
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,534
But... but the crew...

164
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,494
They're all dead,

165
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,829
except for us.

166
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,502
What do we do?

167
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,297
We wait.

168
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,053
And we hope that a passing ship spots us
before that sun...

169
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,307
bleaches our bones.

170
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Now,

171
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,229
this is all the food we got.

172
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,942
So eat slow. There's no more after this.

173
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,478
Why do you get the bigger one?

174
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,032
'Cause I'm three times your size.
That's why!

175
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,951
You know something?

176
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,954
You should be glad
that I'm giving you anything at all.

177
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,333
Now go over to the other side
and keep a lookout.

178
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,797
And I mean it.
Don't you bother me unless you see a ship.

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
You got it?

180
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,800
I said, you got it?

181
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Now go!

182
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,017
Ship!

183
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,774
Ship! Hey!

184
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,318
Hey, ship, over here!

185
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,487
Come on!

186
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,241
Ship!

187
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,324
Please!

188
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,910
Please!

189
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,539
Come on, ship!

190
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,916
No.

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,293
No! No.

192
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,756
No.

193
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,397
The old man had twice as much food.

194
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,276
If he won't give me any,

195
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,529
I'll kill him myself.

196
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,061
I thought I told you to stay put.

197
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,524
You still have some food.
You gotta give me some!

198
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,749
Where is it?!

199
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,503
Where is it?

200
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,759
There's no food! How are you still alive?!

201
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,515
Your leg.

202
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,309
What happened?

203
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,992
You ate it?

204
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,205
You ate your own leg?

205
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,876
You gave me all the food. Why?

206
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,090
You don't even know me.
Why would you do that for a stranger?

207
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,474
Because, little eggplant...

208
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,813
I have been searching for the All Blue...

209
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,482
my whole life.

210
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,990
But now my time has come to an end.

211
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,704
You share the same dream as me.

212
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,750
Believe me,

213
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,087
the All Blue

214
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,797
is real.

215
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,967
It's real.

216
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,720
And if I can't find it...

217
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,015
well, then maybe you can.

218
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,477
So I'm gonna need you to live on.

219
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,231
And I'm gonna need you

220
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,233
to fulfil that dream...

221
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,444
for both of us.

222
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,305
<i>Have any idea what that's like?</i>

223
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,168
Having someone lose a limb
to save your life?

224
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,839
Actually, I kind of do.

225
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,051
Look, all I'm saying is,
we were out there for 85 days.

226
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,972
He could've let me die on that rock.

227
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,184
Instead, he acted like a captain.

228
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,061
He made the tough call.

229
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,274
I'd eat both arms and legs
to save Zoro's life.

230
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,204
"In a certain country,
in the northern seas,

231
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,165
there was an explorer
named Mont Blanc Noland."

232
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,961
"His stories were always grand adventures
that sounded like lies."

233
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,715
"Noland told his king
he found a city of gold,

234
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,301
but when the king
went to claim the treasure,

235
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,345
the city was gone,

236
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,558
and most of the king's soldiers
perished on the journey."

237
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,981
"Noland was sentenced to death,
but he continued to lie to his king,

238
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,943
insisting the city of gold
sank into the sea."

239
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,026
"And...

240
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,948
even though nobody believed him,

241
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,410
he never stopped lying until he was dead."

242
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,703
Poor guy.

243
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,334
Can you imagine that?
Losing a whole city of gold?

244
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,879
I don't think
that was the point of the story.

245
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,965
Stories can have different points.

246
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,216
I mean...

247
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,495
why did the king have to kill him?

248
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:07,599
Sometimes, when you are in charge,
you have to make the tough decisions.

249
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,434
Why does everybody keep saying that?

250
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,270
Because you could've saved Zoro.

251
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,440
He didn't have to fight Mihawk,
but you let it happen.

252
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,150
Why didn't you stop him?

253
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,989
I didn't think he was going to lose.

254
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,326
- You could've tried to change his mind.
- I would never do that.

255
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,495
So you'd rather see him like this?

256
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,540
He might die, Luffy.

257
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,626
And I'd do anything to save him.

258
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,713
Anything.

259
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,343
Except stand in the way of his dream.

260
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,389
- We all have dreams, but we outgrow them.
- Is that really what you think?

261
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,850
Don't you have a dream?

262
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,437
Yeah. Right now,
it's for Zoro to not die in my bed.

263
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,397
But isn't there something that you want?

264
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,065
Something more.

265
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,652
More than anything else in this world.

266
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,699
Not everyone gets to follow their dreams.

267
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,674
Cadet.

268
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,764
- I'm sorry about all this.
- I'm sure you had your reason.

269
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,640
And you already know the reason,
don't you?

270
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,561
- I didn't hear...
- You know Luffy is my grandson.

271
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
I spent years trying to train him.

272
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,822
Trying to build him into a proper Marine.

273
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,826
He resisted me every step of the way.

274
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,829
Wouldn't listen.
Wouldn't learn. Wouldn't cooperate.

275
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,126
You're an exemplary cadet.
The two of you couldn't be more different.

276
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,754
Sir.

277
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,422
Sir.

278
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,135
I spent time with Luffy.

279
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,598
- I know how his mind works.
- So do I. What's your point?

280
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,225
Luffy is different.

281
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,311
He doesn't follow the rules.

282
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,814
He thinks for himself,
no matter what anyone else says.

283
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,066
That's my fault. I was too easy on him.

284
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,026
Sir, it wouldn't have mattered,

285
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,114
because Luffy knows exactly what he is.

286
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,197
And what's that?

287
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,866
A pirate.

288
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,956
Luffy's always been a pirate.
And he always will be a pirate.

289
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,668
No matter how many assassins
you send after him, he'll never change.

290
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,586
He'd rather die first.

291
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,171
Then what do you suggest?

292
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,552
- That I let him be a damn fool pirate?
- Would that be the worst thing, sir?

293
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,437
Maybe you're right.

294
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,440
Maybe I've been going about this
the wrong way all along.

295
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:11,032
Muster the Marines on deck.
I'll address them at afternoon watch.

296
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,284
Yes, sir.

297
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,984
Who's hungry?

298
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,698
Welcome to Baratie.

299
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,908
How can I serve you?

300
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,659
Serve?

301
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,370
Interesting choice of words.

302
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,750
You have food here, don't you?
We wanna eat.

303
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,919
I'm afraid
there are no more tables...

304
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,129
I see a bunch of tables.

305
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,549
Sit down!

306
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,719
No one leaves.

307
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,389
Except you.

308
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,435
Ah!

309
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,357
Let's all enjoy our last meal,

310
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,525
together.

311
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,910
Who are you, old man?

312
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,329
My name is Zeff.

313
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
And I own this place.

314
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,874
Well, I'm Arlong.

315
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,085
And I own the East Blue.

316
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,378
No one owns the sea.

317
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,214
Not even a fishman.

318
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,759
Well, that's about to change,
once you give me what I want.

319
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,842
Ooh.

320
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,224
Listen up. I'm looking
for a pirate in a straw hat.

321
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,268
Goes by the name of Luffy.

322
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,063
He has something that belongs to me.

323
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,816
Straw hat, you say, hmm?

324
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,899
No.

325
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,278
That's not familiar.

326
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,905
But why don't I fix you a meal?

327
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,118
Absolutely anything you want
off of that menu, no charge.

328
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,912
Well, I already have a meal.

329
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,916
But if you don't bring me
the straw-hat boy before I finish,

330
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,962
maybe I might just start adding
some of these nice folks to the menu.

331
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,391
How's he doing?

332
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,729
He hasn't said a word.

333
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,695
Didn't Zeff say we're supposed
to talk to him? Tell him stories?

334
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,946
What would I say?

335
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,948
Whatever pops in your head.

336
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,577
Just... speak from the gut.

337
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,997
My gut hasn't been so great lately.

338
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,498
Well...

339
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,337
at least he'll know it's you.

340
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,133
What do you got to lose?

341
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,432
Hey, Zoro.

342
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,268
What's up?

343
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,730
I just wanted to tell you that...

344
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,401
Let me start over.

345
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,028
I'm just gonna...

346
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,490
Hi, Zoro. Hi.

347
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,995
- You know, it's...
- Luffy!

348
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,830
Luffy!

349
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,133
The Arlong Pirates are at Baratie.
We have to leave now.

350
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,388
- What? Why? Why should we leave?
- Because they're looking for you.

351
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,473
- Me?
- And the map.

352
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,559
Those fishmen will tear this place apart
if Zeff doesn't turn him over.

353
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
Where are you going?

354
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,437
If Baratie's in danger,
I need to be there.

355
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,357
- I'm coming with you.
- Did you not hear what I just said?

356
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,026
They are hunting you. We need to run.

357
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,030
I'm with Nami on this one. I'm really not
trying to ruffle any feathers or scales...

358
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,408
I'm not running.
We're going to protect this place.

359
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,451
This isn't your fight.
Why would you do that?

360
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,120
You fed us.

361
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,124
Look, I know this crew.
Their captain, Arlong,

362
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,334
has the highest bounty
in all of the East Blue.

363
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,963
- You do not want to mess with him.
- It sounds like he messed with us first.

364
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,046
Luffy, please.

365
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,591
Please.

366
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,429
I can't let innocent people get hurt
because of me.

367
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,473
If those fishmen guys want a fight,

368
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,893
we're gonna give them one.

369
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,398
You stay with the ship
and protect the map.

370
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,023
Hmm?

371
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,152
It's gonna be safe with you.

372
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,919
What's the matter?

373
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,923
You never seen a fishman enjoy a meal?

374
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,928
That's because you don't know any fishmen,

375
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,432
except for the ones
who repair your ship or clean your house.

376
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,642
I have nothing against your kind.

377
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,102
That's a shame,

378
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,980
'cause I have everything against yours.

379
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,983
Puny, petulant humans!

380
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,861
You see,

381
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:46,785
most fishmen would be happy
to sit at the same table as a human.

382
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,037
They want to be treated as equals.

383
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,207
But you dare stoop so low.

384
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,212
We all know
there's nothing equal about us.

385
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,925
Fishmen are superior to humans
in every single way.

386
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,303
Stronger, faster,

387
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,222
hungrier.

388
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,016
Wouldn't you agree?

389
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,899
Which one of you is Arlong?

390
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,150
Who is asking?

391
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,777
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

392
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,657
- I hear you're looking for me.
- Why, yes, I am.

393
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,662
So this is the pirate
I've heard so much about?

394
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,499
You know, I was expecting someone... bigger.

395
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,084
So was I.

396
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,504
Do you know who I am, boy?

397
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,549
I'm Arlong the Saw.

398
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,052
Even the Marines flee before my flag.

399
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,389
Not ringing a bell.
How'd you find me anyway?

400
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,934
An old friend helped me track you down.

401
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,774
Heya, Straw Hat. Did you miss me?

402
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,859
Burpy?

403
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,986
What are you doing here?

404
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,363
Believe me,
it wasn't my first choice either.

405
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:10,618
But these fine fishy folk persuaded me
to point them in the right direction,

406
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,371
which ain't easy
when you don't have any hands.

407
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,999
- How'd you even know how to find me?
- I told you.

408
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,502
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

409
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,466
Stereo!

410
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,260
You were listening all along?

411
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,805
- You heard everything?
- Everything.

412
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,098
And that got old quick,

413
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,851
'cause you shidiots have no idea
what you're doing.

414
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,436
Hey, Lips,

415
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,023
how about a scratch
behind the old ear, huh?

416
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,106
Sorry, honey.

417
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,402
Oh, come on! Give a clown a break. I...

418
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:48,823
- Oh, wait! No! Not back in the bag.
- It's so dark and wet and sandy.

419
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,325
Listen here.

420
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,827
I want my map,

421
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,123
along with half
of whatever you plunder as tribute.

422
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,795
And if you bow down to me,
I might even let you serve in my kingdom.

423
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,213
I don't bow down to any man.

424
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,465
I'm no man.

425
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,550
Or fish.

426
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,718
And you're no king.

427
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,930
I will be when I get my Grand Line map.

428
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,142
Then...

429
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,688
you're gonna have to fight me for it.

430
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,607
Then let the fighting begin.

431
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,124
Zeff!

432
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,543
Ah!

433
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,968
Ah!

434
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,718
Ah!

435
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,305
Really great fighter.

436
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,526
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh.

437
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,368
Gum Gum

438
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,704
Pistol!

439
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,708
Uh...

440
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,503
Get up!

441
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,229
Not bad for a human.

442
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,693
Ay.

443
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,990
- Uh?
- Oh, big mistake.

444
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,784
Now I'm gonna
have to make an example out of you.

445
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,716
I told you in the bar
I didn't have any friends, but

446
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,803
the truth is,
I couldn't let myself have them...

447
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,893
because I always end up
hurting the people closest to me.

448
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,330
I don't know
what's so special about you, boy.

449
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,832
Why don't you come find out?

450
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Ah!

451
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,586
Ah!

452
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,216
Come on, fish guy.

453
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,468
Is that all you got?

454
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,305
Ah!

455
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,225
Ah!

456
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,687
Ah!

457
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,945
How about a drink?

458
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,240
Whoa!

459
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,170
Arlong, wait!

460
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,634
I have it.

461
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,345
I have the map.

462
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,224
I got it for you,
just like I said I would.

463
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,308
Nami?

464
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,979
- What are you doing?
- I tried to tell you, Luffy.

465
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,523
I was never on your crew.

466
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,611
I only joined up with you
so I could steal the map.

467
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,659
I don't believe that.

468
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:48,080
That's because you only believe what
you want to believe. Doesn't make it true.

469
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:53,085
Sister Nami's a loyal member
of the Arlong Pirates.

470
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,880
She has been for years.

471
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,843
We have the map, Arlong.

472
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,011
Let's go.

473
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,890
Not until I finish my meal.

474
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:10,770
Why waste your time
killing a Devil Fruit eater?

475
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,858
Let the sea do it for you.

476
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,012
Where's Nami?

477
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,390
She's gone.

478
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,393
She's a member of Arlong's crew.

479
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,314
No.

480
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,276
She can't be.

481
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,540
Attention!

482
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,127
At ease.

483
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,213
Marines,

484
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:08,137
you've done an outstanding job
pursuing these pirates we've been chasing.

485
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,058
I'm proud of your efforts
to apprehend these miscreants.

486
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,643
But I've underestimated their resolve,

487
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,273
their determination
to flaunt their illegal activities.

488
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,652
They are becoming more than a nuisance

489
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,697
and must be treated as such.

490
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,201
So our mission has changed.

491
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,787
No more half measures.

492
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,039
No more soft targets.

493
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,709
The Straw Hats and their captain
will never surrender.

494
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,797
So the gloves are coming off!

495
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,050
We will capture them.

496
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,262
And they will be brought to justice!

497
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,265
I don't need you to do that.

498
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,893
We've got a full house tomorrow.
Two dinner seatings, plus brunch.

499
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,520
Enough! I don't wanna hear this.

500
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,439
- What is your problem?
- Me?

501
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,067
I'm fine. You're the one with the problem.

502
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,777
I'm just helping you clean up.

503
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,030
Yeah, but no one asked you to, did they?
So get out of my restaurant now.

504
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,740
I told you I'm not gonna be a waiter.

505
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,909
You're not gonna be anything,
not if you stay here.

506
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,163
I did not save your life
so you could waste it at Baratie.

507
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,039
It's not like I can just leave.

508
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,040
Why the hell not?

509
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,042
Because you couldn't run this place
without me.

510
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,504
Oh, please, little eggplant,
your cooking is for shit.

511
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,465
At least I don't drown everything
in oregano.

512
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,634
Yeah, at least I'm not the one
who goes on moaning about the All Blue.

513
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,597
You've been yammering on about that
since you was a snotty-nosed little brat.

514
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:19,477
Well, I'll tell you now.
If it means that much to you, go find it.

515
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,938
Look, do you want me to quit?
Is that what you want?

516
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,523
Quitting is staying here!

517
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,277
Don't you get it?

518
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,614
It's one thing to have a dream.
It's another to go after it.

519
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,702
Chore Boy offered me a spot on his crew.
Maybe I'll take him up on that offer.

520
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,245
You want my permission? You got it.

521
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,040
- Fine!
- Fine!

522
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,123
Fine!

523
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,694
Hey, Zoro.

524
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,198
You sure missed a big fight.

525
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,452
Those fishmen guys were tough.

526
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,039
You would've loved it.

527
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,585
And we had a pretty great dinner.

528
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,381
All of us sitting around together,

529
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,467
listening to Usopp's stories.

530
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,848
Only I kind of messed it up.

531
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,396
And now I lost Nami.

532
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,360
I lost the Grand Line map.

533
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,533
And maybe I will lose you too.

534
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,081
I didn't know what to say before,

535
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,502
but I know what to say now,
and it's so simple.

536
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,010
I need you, Zoro.

537
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,265
I need you

538
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,644
to wake up.

539
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,192
You gonna keep talking,
or let me get some sleep?

540
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,196
Zoro?

541
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,574
Zoro!

542
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,618
Zoro, you're not dead!

543
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,621
Oh!

544
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,541
Right now, I'm wishing I was.

545
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,625
Oh.

546
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,049
I had the strangest dream

547
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,843
that Nami left.

548
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,428
She did.

549
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,182
It's my fault.

550
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,187
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

551
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,731
You acted like a captain.

552
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,524
But our crew is falling apart.

553
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,026
No, it's not.

554
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,201
I, Roronoa Zoro...

555
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,372
vow to stand by your side

556
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
from now

557
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,627
until the end.

558
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,921
Until we find the One Piece

559
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,548
or die trying.

560
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,971
So bring on the Marines
or pirates or sea beasts.

561
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,811
You're my captain, Luffy,

562
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,271
and I'm your first mate.

563
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,359
Zoro!

564
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,363
Zoro!

565
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,324
I wasn't worried for a second.

566
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,451
He's alive!

567
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,869
Oh.

568
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,290
And I told 'em. I said, "You'd better not
mess with the Straw Hats!"

569
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,875
- Yeah!
- Ba! Ba!

570
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:12,960
Hoo!

571
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,923
Sent 'em swimming for their lives.

572
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,134
- You scared 'em off, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

573
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,262
- The Great Captain Usopp.
- Yeah.

574
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,849
So what do we do now?
Plot a course for the Grand Line?

575
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,935
Nope.

576
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,937
But I thought
we were going after the One Piece?

577
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,020
We are.

578
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,651
But we can't do it without our whole crew.

579
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,610
First...

580
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,284
we're going after Nami.

581
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,753
Lot of dried meat in these barrels.

582
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,761
- You think we brought too much?
- You know who you're sailing with?

583
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,556
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

584
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,101
Heard you guys need a cook.

585
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,899
Yeah! Yes, we do!

586
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,696
Welcome aboard.

587
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,462
- Why are we bringing the waiter?
- Because we can't boil water.

588
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,047
Dropping the sail!

589
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,179
Casting off.

590
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,214
Hey, Sanji!

591
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,806
You keep your feet dry.

592
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:33,933
Goodbye, Zeff.

593
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,439
You know, all these years,

594
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,527
living under your shitty roof,
cooking at your shitty restaurant...

595
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,366
I owe you my life!

596
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,249
Thank you for putting up with my shit
all these years, old man.

597
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,466
I'll never forget you, Zeff!

598
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,622
So we're... we're going after Nami,
but how are we gonna find her?

599
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,291
Yeah, we don't even know where she is.

600
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,752
I know someone who does.

601
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,067
Hello, boys!
