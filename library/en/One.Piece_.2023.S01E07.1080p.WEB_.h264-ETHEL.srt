1
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,184
But you said five degrees starboard.

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,604
Yeah, it's the other starboard,
Captain Shit-tastic.

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,607
- Thought clowns were supposed to be funny.
- What was that?

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,901
Why don't you say it to my face?

5
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,488
Hey! Morning, champ.

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,324
I know Luffy made a deal with you
to find Arlong, clown,

7
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,952
but if this is another trick...

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,204
What are you gonna do? Bleed on me?

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,833
Whoa! Whoa! Wait.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What?

10
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,270
Because I said bleed on me?
You can bleed on me if you want.

11
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,255
I mean, a deal's a deal, all right?
You want your map back. I want my body.

12
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,178
How do we know
you're not leading us to a trap?

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,676
Zoro, buddy!

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,636
Honor amongst pirates. Right?

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,556
Come on. How about I sing
a nice sea shanty to pass the time.

16
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>♪ Oh, there once was a girl
With tangerine hair ♪</i>

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>♪ Stole my map
And left me stranded somewhere ♪</i>

18
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>♪ Truly a crafty and crooked young lass ♪</i>

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,733
<i>♪ But you can't deny
She had a spectacular... ♪</i>

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,360
Ow! God, right on my nose!

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,575
Does it always take this long?

22
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,869
We've only been here two minutes.
Be patient.

23
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,413
Some days, they bite
as soon as you drop the line,

24
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,832
and some days, it takes hours.

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,877
And then there are days
when you don't catch anything at all.

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,505
But we're not talking
about fishing, are we?

27
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,051
I just want to know if Nami's okay.

28
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,179
A beautiful, talented woman
does not choose to ally herself

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,014
with a pirate like Arlong.

30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,267
- Nami clearly needs to be rescued.
- Her tattoo says different.

31
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,355
Well, tattoos don't tell the whole story.
And like any woman, she's a mystery.

32
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,482
- Nami made her choice.
- You don't know why.

33
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,777
Only thing I want to hear from you
are dinner specials. You don't know Nami.

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,197
- Sounds like you don't know her either.
- I'm sure Nami has her reasons.

35
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,368
Whatever choice she makes...

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,205
I just need to hear it for myself.

37
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,582
Land ho!

38
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,695
- I'm gonna get you!
- No, you're not!

39
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,446
- I'm faster than you.
- You wish.

40
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,889
Snap.

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,689
Nami, it's your turn.

42
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,358
Nami.

43
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,652
<i>Nami.</i>

44
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,113
Nami.

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,532
Your bet.

46
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,996
Five hundred.

47
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,012
Any day now.

48
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,180
I'm thinking.

49
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,141
Oh, what's the matter?
Can't count any higher than five?

50
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,357
All in.

51
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,656
All in.

52
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,907
Oh!

53
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,827
Straight.

54
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,412
Ten high.

55
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,960
Queens full.

56
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,920
Ooh!

57
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,714
You're a liar,

58
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,507
and you're a cheat.

59
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,806
You know we don't lie about money
on this crew.

60
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,478
All right, game's over.
Nami, Arlong wants a word.

61
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,147
Sorry, boys.

62
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,985
I'll be back
for the rest of your Berry later.

63
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,229
Girls, wash up for dinner.

64
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,649
{\an8}They had day-old biscuits
in the bakery today.

65
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,110
{\an8}Half price, but they taste just the same.

66
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,322
- What's that?
- Nothing.

67
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,622
Where did you get this?

68
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,127
Where did you get the book, Nami?

69
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,924
I took it from the bookstore.

70
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,467
Why would you do that?

71
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,760
Because I wanted it.

72
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,556
You're gonna
have to do better than that.

73
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,139
Okay, I didn't have any money.

74
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,226
What? It's not like I hurt anybody.

75
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,103
You hurt the people you stole from.

76
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,731
- And yourself.
- No, they don't know what it's like.

77
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,693
I hate eating tangerines every day.
I hate wearing Nojiko's hand-me-downs.

78
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,278
I hate being poor!

79
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,949
We may not have much, but we have a roof
over our heads and we love each other.

80
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,369
- That's what makes us a family.
- No! We're not a real family.

81
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,872
Nojiko's not my sister.
And you're not even my mom!

82
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,315
I kept a plate on the stove for you.

83
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,941
I'm not hungry.

84
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,457
The day I found you and Nojiko,

85
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,963
my unit had been dispatched to engage
a band of pirates in the Oykot Kingdom.

86
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,340
<i>But we got separated.</i>

87
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:52,305
<i>By the end of it, I was wounded, starving.</i>

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,475
I thought I was gonna die.

89
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,274
When I saw you...

90
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,405
<i>I knew I had to live.</i>

91
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,950
<i>I had to live so I could take care of you.</i>

92
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,829
How did you know?

93
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,501
<i>I just knew.</i>

94
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,215
It was the right thing to do.

95
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,888
I know you'll do the right thing too.

96
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,325
There's a lot of memories in this room.

97
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,077
But you...

98
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,622
you should be proud.

99
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,416
What do I have to be proud of?

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,128
Oh, you sell yourself too short, Nami.

101
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,883
Thanks to you, we know every Marine base
and pirate stronghold

102
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,885
from here to the Goa Kingdom.

103
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,137
- But none of it's mine.
- True.

104
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,307
But you're still
a valued member of this crew, Nami.

105
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
Yeah, we make a great team.

106
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,565
You were gone so long, part of me
thought you might not be coming back.

107
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,400
Of course I came back.

108
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
We have a deal, don't we?

109
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,490
Yeah. I'm a fishman of my word.

110
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,210
Mmm.

111
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,670
Good girl.

112
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,259
Soon, fishmen will rule the East Blue.

113
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:59,515
And then on to the Grand Line
and every other sea after that.

114
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,685
I think the Marines might have
something to say about that.

115
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,562
Marines can be bought and sold.

116
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,400
And once they've outlived
their usefulness, crushed.

117
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,944
You think killing humans
will solve all your problems.

118
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,070
Not all.

119
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,782
You see, when an animal grows too wild,

120
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,496
it must be brought to heel.

121
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,292
Don't worry.
I won't forget all your hard work.

122
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,503
You'll have a special place in my empire.

123
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,672
I'd better.

124
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,017
Oh, Nami.

125
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,228
How I've missed you.

126
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,398
But you know, I have another job for you
in the meantime.

127
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,652
One of the villages
is late with their tribute payment.

128
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,986
Which one?

129
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,696
Coco Village.

130
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,370
I'm not exactly welcome there.
Can't you send Kuroobi or Chu?

131
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:07,625
No. This job requires a human touch.

132
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,445
Dining room is closed for renovations.

133
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,323
We need to speak to the owner.

134
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,034
I'm afraid the chef is busy with...

135
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,080
My apologies. Of course.
He'll be right with you.

136
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,585
- It's a nice place.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
My dad used to eat here all the time.

138
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,923
Not that he ever took me, but...

139
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,811
Marines, and a Vice-Admiral at that.

140
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,458
A little late to the party, aren't we?

141
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,819
I always wondered what happened
to the infamous Red Leg Zeff.

142
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,239
- Sir, do you know this man?
- Only by reputation.

143
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,242
Captain of the Cook Pirates.

144
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,536
Yeah, well, those days are far behind me.

145
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,830
I'm retired. I'm a chef now.

146
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,293
And the only thing under my command
is this restaurant.

147
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,044
We're not here for you, Red Leg.

148
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,631
We need some information about
a young pirate who was here recently.

149
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,966
Name of Luffy.

150
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,053
- I can't help you.
- Can't? Or won't?

151
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,639
These days, I'm lucky
if I remember my regulars.

152
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,225
Oh, you'll remember this one. Straw hat.

153
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,061
Always running his big mouth.

154
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,772
No, I'm drawing a blank.

155
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
But how about a meal on the house?

156
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,363
I got a dozen T-bone steaks
and a busted cooler.

157
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,659
It'd be such a shame to let
all that delicious marbling go to waste.

158
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,620
We're not here for a meal. We're here...

159
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,704
That steak...

160
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Medium rare?

161
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,585
More rare than medium.

162
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,905
Never seen that before.

163
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,241
What could have done this?

164
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,454
Maybe I should head back,
make sure the Merry's secure.

165
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,457
Arlong did this.

166
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,170
Hey, shit-hat! I think we
can all agree that Arlong's a bad fish.

167
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,454
But why don't we quit lollygagging
and get my body back?

168
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,007
Pipe down in there.

169
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,009
Or what?
You gonna whip me up a soufflé?

170
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,429
- How about you take him for a while?
- Ooh, new guy carries the clown head.

171
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,313
Everyone! Please!

172
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,150
Please, everyone.

173
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,697
We don't have much time,
and we're short again this month.

174
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,077
Is it enough?

175
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,707
- Do we have time to get some more?
- No.

176
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,667
You don't.

177
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,420
It's Nami.

178
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,396
You've got a lot of nerve
showing your face here.

179
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,706
Got something for me?

180
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,291
You got something for me?

181
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm sorry I took the map book.

182
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,561
- And you promise to never steal again?
- I promise.

183
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,233
- Your fingers crossed behind your back?
- Maybe.

184
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,405
You're not a bad kid, Nami.

185
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
You just did a bad thing.

186
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,495
Next time, come to me first.

187
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,207
Maybe we can have you
do some odd jobs around town.

188
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,311
- Thank you, Mr. Genzo.
- You did the right thing.

189
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,797
Help! Ah! Help! Everyone!

190
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,174
Pirates! They're attacking the village!

191
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,760
- What's going on?
- Help! Everyone, pirates!

192
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,887
There's pirates!

193
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,101
Citizens of Coco Village!

194
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,522
This town belongs to me!

195
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,743
Run!

196
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,278
You're short.

197
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,407
Nami, please. This is all we have.

198
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,661
- Arlong has bled us dry.
- Then find more blood.

199
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,172
Luffy?

200
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,968
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

201
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,637
- This is where I belong.
- I don't believe that.

202
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,767
- This is not you.
- No. This isn't the me you want me to be.

203
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,018
Nami...

204
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,355
if you need our help...

205
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,442
No, I don't need any of you.

206
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,323
Arlong wanted the map,
and I conned you into getting it for me.

207
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,533
And you bought it.

208
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,497
I was never part of your stupid crew.

209
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,292
You don't mean that.

210
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,421
Take the rest of these clowns
and sail away from here.

211
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,299
I never want to see you again.

212
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,067
Okay, that went about as bad as it could.

213
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,654
So back to the boat
before the fishmen find us?

214
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,116
- Sail the hell out of here? Okay.
- There's something else going on here.

215
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,159
She was very clear she wants us to leave.

216
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,328
You don't know women.
They never say what they mean.

217
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,124
- Tell me again why the cook gets a say.
- Don't you guys get it? She's one of them.

218
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,586
She's a bad guy.
The villagers are terrified of her.

219
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,796
Not all of them.

220
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,509
Hey!

221
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,427
Scar guy.

222
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,892
Who was that lady?

223
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,935
You know,

224
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,021
the one with the cool hair?

225
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,231
Who wants to know?

226
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,775
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

227
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,278
- I'm a pirate...
- Hunter.

228
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,113
Pirate hunter.

229
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,451
- We're here to collect Arlong's bounty.
- You?

230
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,621
I've seen men twice your size

231
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,249
and with twice your number
go into Arlong Park.

232
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,168
None of them ever came back.

233
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,105
- We just want to talk to her.
- Trust me, you don't.

234
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,256
But if it'll get you out of my town,

235
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,720
try the house down that road,
on the edge of the tangerine grove.

236
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,066
I think I got more of a boat body
than a long-journey-on-foot kind of body.

237
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,195
Anybody else missing the ocean?

238
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,905
No? Okay.

239
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,368
I could go bring the boat around
if we don't want to walk all the way back.

240
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,302
- Whoa!
- Turn around and leave. Now.

241
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,762
That's what I've been saying.

242
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,305
Hey, I saw you earlier.

243
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,851
I think maybe you and I have
something in common.

244
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,146
I've got the gun,
and you're standing in front of it.

245
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,358
- What could we possibly have in common?
- Let's start with Nami.

246
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,779
- Seems you know her very well.
- She's a thief with no conscience.

247
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,574
And when there's no more left to take,
she leaves and doesn't turn back.

248
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,286
- Now get off my property.
- Nami's part of our crew.

249
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,788
She's our friend.

250
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,834
My sister doesn't have any friends.

251
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,547
- The sooner you realize that, the better.
- Sisters. That makes sense.

252
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,759
- Both as beautiful as each other.
- Give it up.

253
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,553
I can tell
she really did a number on you guys.

254
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,223
You're not special,

255
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,267
and I can't help you.

256
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,852
- How about a meal?
- What?

257
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,773
An exchange of sorts
for your valuable time and information.

258
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,942
- You cook?
- He's a waiter.

259
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,277
Best cook in the East Blue.

260
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,571
You never tasted anything better
in your life. Usopp's word!

261
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,908
Ain't got much to cook with.

262
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,661
You'd be surprised how much I can make
with very few ingredients.

263
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,328
What do you say?

264
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,166
We have a little dinner,
a little conversation.

265
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
Fine.

266
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,673
But there'd better be dessert.

267
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,142
Mmm.

268
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,397
Mmm.

269
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,403
This is nothing.
You should see him at a curry house.

270
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,159
A fair bit better
than Marine rations, huh?

271
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,290
I didn't know you had the pleasure
of dining on a Marine vessel.

272
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,416
Only in the brig.

273
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,053
Where is he, Zeff? I know Luffy was here.

274
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,764
This is a rare vintage from Micqueot.

275
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,227
I've been saving it for something special.

276
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,855
It's been a while since I've run into
anyone from the old days,

277
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,900
even if we did find ourselves
on opposite sides of a cannon.

278
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,444
Finally got yourself
on the right side of the law.

279
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,657
The law had nothing to do with it.
It was time to stop.

280
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,743
I took my choice.

281
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,038
There's a new generation,
and they're coming up.

282
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,082
It's their time now.

283
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,125
Like hell it is.

284
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,586
Bunch of impulsive children.

285
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,093
Perfectly aged and ready to be enjoyed.

286
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,886
You leave it too long,

287
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,555
it'll go bad.

288
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,233
Or you could just serve whiskey.

289
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,770
Yeah!

290
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,938
Come on!

291
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,118
Arlong, we need to talk
about Coco Village.

292
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:17,164
We can talk tomorrow.
Coco Village will still be there,

293
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,333
provided they paid the tribute in full.

294
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,879
That's what we need to talk about.
That and the terms of our deal.

295
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,964
Always so serious, Nami.

296
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,342
Have a drink. Relax.

297
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,566
Captain Nezumi. What a pleasant surprise.

298
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,610
Always good to catch up, Arlong.

299
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,238
Although, I hear troubling news from Gosa.

300
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,825
Seems they've recently
been raided by pirates.

301
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,327
So terrible.

302
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,496
There are other reports as well

303
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,042
about fishmen stirring things up
around the Conomi Islands.

304
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,305
I have additional concerns.

305
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,098
How many?

306
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,312
- About twice as many as that.
- That's double our usual arrangement.

307
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,939
Times are changing.

308
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,691
It's getting harder than ever
to cover up your tracks.

309
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,693
Nami.

310
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,367
This is a party.

311
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,995
Let's go upstairs to discuss our business.

312
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,208
Nami, join us.

313
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,547
Dinner's served.

314
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,676
Mmm.

315
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,849
Told you.

316
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,986
You know, this is the best thing
I've eaten in my entire life.

317
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,073
Listen. There's plenty more
where that came from, but...

318
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,244
first, we really need to know about Nami.

319
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,457
The truth is...

320
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,547
- What's going on?
- Get in. Get in. Close the door.

321
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,630
Mom!

322
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,341
Get in.

323
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,302
- Mom, please.
- Stay put.

324
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,178
And no matter what you hear,
do not come out.

325
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,262
Mom!

326
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,230
Who's there?

327
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,621
Is that any way to treat a guest?

328
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,296
Tribute is 100,000 Berry per adult.

329
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,131
Go fetch it.

330
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,310
Take it. It's all I got.

331
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Good.

332
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,797
Three plates on the table.

333
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,964
How many people live here?

334
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,257
Only one.

335
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,220
No record of any family.

336
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,688
How many people live here?

337
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
How many?

338
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,951
- I have two daughters.
- You'll have to pay for them.

339
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,371
- Fifty thousand Berry each.
- I gave you everything I have.

340
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,331
Too bad for you. It ain't enough.

341
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,667
Don't you hurt her!

342
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,547
- Mom.
- Oh, it's a family reunion.

343
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,216
The little humans, so precious.

344
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,760
Precious.

345
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,773
The money, will you take it as tribute
for my daughters?

346
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,066
No, Mom, you can't!

347
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,527
You understand what you're saying?

348
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,071
- I do.
- No, Mom!

349
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,117
Why didn't you just lie?
You didn't have to tell him about us.

350
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,660
Because you are my daughters,

351
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,288
and I would never deny that.

352
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,918
You deserve to live full and happy lives.

353
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,755
I'm sorry I couldn't do more for you.

354
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,884
Buy you nice things
or cook you nice meals.

355
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,597
I'm sorry I wasn't a very good mother.

356
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,974
No. No, don't say that.

357
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,776
Mom, no.

358
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,737
Mom, no! No! No! No!

359
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,533
Nami, Nojiko,

360
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,494
I love you, girls.

361
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,099
Wait. Nami's working for the pirate
that killed your mother?

362
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,294
She was just a kid.

363
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,387
She's not anymore.

364
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,057
She made her choice.

365
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,813
I'm tired of hearing about Nami
from other people.

366
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,607
She told you to leave, Luffy.

367
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,568
So did you.

368
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,242
How do you know
she's not one of Arlong's crew?

369
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,288
Same way I knew you weren't gonna kill me
when I cut you down from that cross.

370
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,790
Same way I knew about Usopp

371
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,876
and Sanji.

372
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,086
Yeah, I don't know about that waiter.

373
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,797
I know Nami's good.

374
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,676
She needs to know it too.

375
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,361
Tell me, Captain.
What's a fair price for your discretion?

376
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,197
Ten thousand Berry?

377
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,240
Twenty thousand?

378
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,369
I thought we had a fair deal.

379
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,039
It's not easy
keeping Marine patrols out of the area.

380
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,625
And with your increase in activity,

381
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,797
it'd be a shame if word of this
got back to Marine headquarters.

382
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,756
Hmm.

383
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,973
I guess it's just the price
of doing business.

384
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,977
You're a lot smarter than people
give you credit for.

385
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,773
Because I'm a fishman?

386
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,275
That's not what I...

387
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,611
Does it surprise you
that I have intelligence?

388
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,738
Ambition?

389
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,743
Usage beyond manual labor for humans?

390
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,415
Not at all. I've personally
never felt any ill will toward your kind.

391
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:25,503
And yet the leaders of the organization
you so proudly represent

392
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,714
saw fit to disparage

393
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,633
and enslave my people.

394
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,511
- Slavery has been abolished.
- But your prejudice remains.

395
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,389
Fishmen have all the same rights
as humans.

396
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,472
Do we?

397
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,480
The World Government has worked very hard

398
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:49,027
to foster better relations
between our people to keep the peace.

399
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,071
A fishman
is one of the Warlords of the Sea.

400
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,823
Jimbei is a fool!

401
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,160
A government dog to an inferior master.

402
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,538
I serve no man.

403
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,209
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.

404
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,088
I can accept the terms of our usual deal.

405
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,432
Yes.

406
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,228
You're smarter than people
give you credit for.

407
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,616
- And what about our deal, Arlong?
- What about it?

408
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,700
I have the money.

409
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,663
A hundred million Berry?

410
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,795
Nami... have you been holding out on me?

411
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,423
I stole that money fair and square.
Now are you ready to honor our agreement?

412
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,014
Bring the money to me by sunrise,

413
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,726
and I will consider the matter closed.

414
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,072
- Kuroobi.
- Mmm.

415
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,324
Bring Nezumi back in here.

416
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,576
- Go.
- Aye.

417
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,459
Maybe there's a way for the rat
to earn some extra Berry after all.

418
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,302
- Two Mistral Shooters, good man.
- Coming right up.

419
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,806
- What are you doing?
- Buying you a drink.

420
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,351
- You're welcome.
- We can't. We're on duty.

421
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,186
Oh, come on.

422
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,153
Might as well enjoy this wild goose chase.

423
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,241
Not much of a drinker, are you?

424
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:07,039
I still don't know why Garp has such
a bug up his arse about this Straw Hat.

425
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,381
- Two more.
- Aren't you full of surprises?

426
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,893
Is this really
what we're supposed to be doing?

427
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,227
What are you talking about?

428
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,776
Maybe the Straw Hat Pirates
aren't the villains

429
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,398
the Marines are making them out to be.

430
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,569
Thought it'd take a lot more liquor
to bring out your mutinous side.

431
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,072
It just seems like
if we keep making the same mistakes,

432
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,782
nothing's ever gonna change.

433
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,454
All right, out with it.

434
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,123
You know something.

435
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,422
Garp is Luffy's grandfather.

436
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,889
Of all the things I thought you were going
to say, that wasn't even on the list.

437
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,433
I should've known
from the way they both love meat.

438
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
You can't tell anyone.

439
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,188
It makes sense.

440
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:18,486
Why else would a vice-admiral be going
after some rubber kid playing pirate?

441
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,154
He's not playing.

442
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,490
Say what you want about Luffy,
but he's the real deal.

443
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,076
It doesn't matter. Not to a man like Garp.

444
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,121
You color outside the lines,
you get your arm chopped off.

445
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,251
- What?
- Seems like you can relate.

446
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,897
Must've been hard growing up
with a dad like...

447
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,924
I am nothing like that Straw Hat!

448
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,095
Fellow with a straw hat
came through here the other day.

449
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,222
Do you know where he was heading?

450
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,641
I might.

451
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,811
What's it worth to you?

452
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,106
And then the creature turns towards me,

453
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,400
flaring its tusks.

454
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,986
The last of the wild boars of Jaya.

455
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,155
Two days.

456
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,616
Two days, I wrestled that crazed hog

457
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,827
until finally I prevailed.

458
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,789
And I cooked it over an open flame,

459
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,042
and I ate it with my bare hands.

460
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,170
Just fire and flesh.

461
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,882
- And how did it taste?
- Oh.

462
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,012
That meat, whoa.

463
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,390
It was so tender,
it near melted off the bone.

464
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,892
It was the best meal I've ever had.

465
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,315
The longer they elude you,
the more satisfying the catch.

466
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,402
You know,

467
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,241
you're not tricking me
with your delicious stories.

468
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,285
I'm not hunting a boar.

469
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:55,374
The last thing I want to do is... put myself
in the middle of a family dispute.

470
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,211
The kid's special.

471
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,342
Reminds me of another pirate we knew
back in our glory days.

472
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,301
Don't say it.

473
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,053
It's not gonna make it less true.

474
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,098
The kid reminds me of Gold Roger.

475
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,189
And look what happened to him.

476
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,149
Executed.

477
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,318
Skewered by Marine polearms.

478
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,737
I don't want my...

479
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,870
I don't want the boy
to suffer the same fate.

480
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,623
He stood up for Baratie
when we were attacked.

481
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,209
I might be out of the game,
but I still live by the code.

482
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,292
Sir?

483
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,639
Thank you for the meal.

484
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,480
Have the navigator
set a course immediately

485
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,440
for the Conomi Islands.

486
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,025
- Aye, sir.
- Garp.

487
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,740
You have to know
when it's time to let them go.

488
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,326
Change is coming
whether you want it or not.

489
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,829
It's their turn now.

490
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,664
Hmm.

491
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,834
We'll see about that.

492
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:36,183
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

493
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,268
boom!

494
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,607
Yeah, I'm gonna go get some air.

495
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,777
Can you just be quiet?

496
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,489
Aw, come on. Where's the fun in that?

497
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,411
Do you really think your little toys
can get through the skin of a fishman?

498
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,748
- These are smoke bombs.
- Smoke?

499
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,959
That's rich.

500
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:06,505
Makes me think of how long it's been
since I've had any smoked fish.

501
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,385
Maybe if you guys had some extra?

502
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,052
Please?

503
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,766
Ah, screw you guys!

504
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,728
Arlong's gonna bite
the shit out of you anyway.

505
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,272
You know you don't stand a chance
against him and his army.

506
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,025
And you dumb pieces of garbage,

507
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,986
you ain't gonna do anything
against that stupid...

508
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,241
New guy shuts up the clown head.

509
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,702
How dare you?

510
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,957
It's not enough that you're working
for our mother's killer,

511
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,417
but now you're desecrating her grave too?

512
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,920
Nojiko. Nojiko, wait!

513
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,675
It's not what you think.

514
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,927
You have no idea what I think.

515
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,136
Ah!

516
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,849
What's this?

517
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,272
Is this the money that you stole?

518
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,775
And you're hiding it
next to our mother's body?

519
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,447
- Nami, what kind of monster are you?
- You don't understand.

520
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,991
Then make me understand.

521
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,339
I need to speak with you.

522
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,886
- And who are you?
- My name is Nami. You killed my mother.

523
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,970
Nami.

524
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,475
Oh, right, I did. The ex-Marine.

525
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,520
She was brave. I'll give her that.

526
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,356
Let me guess.
You've come to even the score.

527
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,820
You want to kill me, little girl?

528
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,447
No.

529
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,533
I want to join your crew.

530
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,792
That is rich.

531
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,796
But why would I ever let a human
onto my crew?

532
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,882
Because I have something you want.

533
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,557
You drew this?

534
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,186
This is good.

535
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,604
Very good.

536
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,526
Maybe the best I've seen in the East Blue,
fishman or human.

537
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,488
So let me join your crew,
and I'll help you.

538
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,572
Help me?

539
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,498
I killed your mother,

540
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,670
and now you want to come work for me?

541
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,255
Hmm.

542
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,300
Why would you do that?

543
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,178
Because you have something I want.

544
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,600
<i>I told Arlong
I'd work for him on one condition.</i>

545
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,311
That he let me buy back Coco Village.

546
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,231
And he said he would

547
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,317
for a hundred million Berry.

548
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,444
A hundred million?

549
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,865
- That would take a lifetime.
- I have the money.

550
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,535
All of it.

551
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,123
And now I can buy the freedom
of the village and everyone in it.

552
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,339
So...

553
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,136
this whole time,

554
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,763
you were trying to help.

555
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,101
Why didn't you tell me?

556
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:37,818
- Nami, I'm your sister. Why didn't you...
- I couldn't lose you too.

557
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
Or anyone else.

558
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,414
So you kept that secret all these years.

559
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,376
And you let me hate you.

560
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,048
I hated you.

561
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,979
A shame to break up
this touching scene.

562
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,984
I've heard that pirates
are stashing their plunder in this area.

563
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,487
You two wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

564
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,949
That's obviously been stolen.

565
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,661
By the authority of the Marines
and the World Government,

566
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,330
I'm going to have to confiscate it.

567
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:35,042
- No, you can't do that. It's mine!
- A hundred million Berry?

568
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,711
And where would <i>you</i> get that much money?

569
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,923
How did you know it was a hundred...

570
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,886
Arlong put you up to this, didn't he?

571
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,974
I... I don't know what you mean.

572
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,270
- No!
- Watch yourself.

573
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,189
Or we will take you into custody as well.

574
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,694
No!

575
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,864
You can't do this.

576
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,450
You can't do this!

577
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,959
No!

578
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,341
Nami, wait.

579
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,134
Wait. Nami, stop! Wait. Wait!

580
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,222
- Nami.
- Let me go! Let me go! They can't do this!

581
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:34,226
- There's nothing you can do!
- Arlong will kill the entire village!

582
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
Nami, wait!

583
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,275
<i>My brothers!</i>

584
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,332
We all know the truth of this world.

585
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:03,046
Fishmen are
the rightful rulers of the seas.

586
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,965
And the humans know it too.

587
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:10,429
They fear our power,
so they bound us with chains.

588
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:15,350
They loathe our presence,
so they banned us from their cities.

589
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,521
But we broke those chains, huh?

590
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,691
Built our own cities.

591
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:28,572
Now the time has come to restore
the natural order of this world.

592
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,199
Yeah!

593
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:32,618
No.

594
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,203
Please!

595
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,457
For centuries, humans have used us,

596
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,668
kept us down.

597
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,505
And our so-called leaders,
they allowed it.

598
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,886
Banners of unity and peace
they so lovingly wave

599
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:55,599
are, in truth,
flags of surrender, willing defeat.

600
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,979
I don't know about you,
but I ain't surrendering.

601
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,273
Kill them all!

602
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,358
Yeah!

603
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,489
We are the embodiment
of fishman superiority!

604
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:14,409
And with the Grand Line map,
we will reclaim our birthright.

605
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,913
Our righteous rage
will burn through Coco Village

606
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,748
to the ends of the East Blue,

607
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,960
and as we move
to the Grand Line and beyond,

608
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,756
we will teach each and every human
their rightful place,

609
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,174
beneath us.

610
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,133
Yeah!

611
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,218
Beneath us!

612
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,221
Yeah!

613
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,307
Beneath us! Yeah!

614
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,726
Yeah!

615
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,454
Arlong.

616
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,296
Arlong.

617
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,471
Arlong.

618
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,728
Arlong!

619
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,897
Arlong!

620
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,025
Ah!

621
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,610
Arlong!

622
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,863
Arlong!

623
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,949
Arlong!

624
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,136
I told you to get the hell out of here.

625
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,387
You did.

626
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,978
Then leave.

627
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,608
You don't know
anything about what's going on here.

628
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,485
I don't.

629
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,375
Luffy.

630
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,801
Help me.

631
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,409
Of course I will.

632
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,921
Of course I will.

633
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:23,056
Of course I will!

634
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,985
Let's go.

635
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,070
Right.

636
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,993
What's that?

637
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,246
They're attacking the village.
